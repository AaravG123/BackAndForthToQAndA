What would be a cost-effective and straightforward way to save all my data while running a clean OS on my system? I considered manually picking out files and transferring them to a flash drive, but this seems time-consuming. Any suggestions are appreciated!",
        "answer84": "To save all your data from the HDD while running a clean OS on the SSD, you have a few options. One simple way is to download the Windows installation media, create a bootable USB or DVD, and install Windows on the SSD with the HDD disconnected. Once you've completed the OS installation on the SSD, you can reconnect the old HDD as a secondary drive and access your data from there. This method ensures a clean OS installation without any interference from the old drive. Alternatively, you can use data migration software that allows you to clone the existing HDD to the new SSD, but make sure the SSD's capacity is sufficient to accommodate the data on the HDD."

        "question129": "So, today, when I started my computer, I got a message saying \"Reboot and select proper boot device\". I restarted my computer again, and the message appeared again. I went to my BIOS, and the boot order was correct. My SSD is my primary boot drive, and that is set. I have a 1TB HDD as a secondary drive for extra space. I went to the Boot Menu and selected my SSD from there, and then it booted up normally. This is the first time this has happened. I built this PC 5 years ago. Is it time to get a new one?",
        "answer129": "The \"Reboot and select proper boot device\" message you encountered could be due to a temporary glitch or a loose connection between your SSD and the motherboard. It's possible that the connection got slightly disrupted, leading to the error message during startup. Since you were able to boot up normally after selecting the SSD from the Boot Menu, it indicates that the SSD itself is likely fine. Before considering a new PC, you should first: 1. Check all cables and connections between the SSD and the motherboard, ensuring they are securely attached. 2. Run diagnostics on the SSD to check its health and performance. 3. Verify that the SSD is still set as the primary boot device in the BIOS. If everything else seems to be working well, addressing these issues should resolve the problem, and there might not be a need to get a new PC at this point."
