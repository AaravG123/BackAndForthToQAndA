            "nzalog----1. I beleive Samsungs \"SSD Magician\" might be able to do that.\n2. It should be fine but if possible I'd plug it in on a separate computer and wipe it first. Another option for the the old drive is plug it into the same computer after it's booted into windows and then wipe it. The way to do that is shut down the PC, plug in only the power connector to the HDD. Boot up the computer and then plug in the sata. Most sata is plug and play (some you have to enable it in bios). Should show right up after. Be sure to wipe all the partitions... (diskpart and clean command work great for this but can be very dangerous so be sure you do this right)",

            "JerrWolf----I've done a little research on my mobo and realised that it has an m.2 slot, originally I didn't know.\nI know there is a lot of hype around m.2 NVMe SSDs for \"amazing load times\" and what not. My current system has all SSDs currently in there, 2 from Samsung and 2 from Corsair (these are the two I'd most likely replace). My PC is mostly used for gaming, playing MMORPGs, FFXIV specifically.\nI've looked up some info about M.2 SSDs but the info ranged from 2014 to 2019 so I'm not sure how relevant or factual any of that information is in 2021. They're too expensive (referring to using a single m.2 1tb SSD for your only drive)\nGames do not benefit from M.2 NMVe drives if you are already using SSDs (the performance is the same)\nThe only benefit of M.2 is load times, once a game loads the data it needs from the SSD it no longer needs the SSD.\nI'd like some more recent and professional information on the last 2 parts. If I were to buy an m.2 NVMe drive, I'd probably buy a 500gb or 1tb drive and load my OS and games onto that. 1tb is certainly enough and 500gb would be doable. It would be replacing 2 of my older SSDs. Would I see an actual difference? My OS is currently on a Samsung 850 EVO SSD, and my games on a partition made across the 850 PRO and 2 Corsair SSDs I have. Another question is I understand that a game only takes from the SSD when it loads so \"M.2 don't really give benefit to games\" it's under my impression this kind of info usually refers to single player games, or multiplayer games, like Skyrim, or Battlefield.\nI play MMORPG games though which tend to load things in and out very often. Loading between different zones in the game, loading in different players, different models, effects etc etc.\nDoes this make the above info irrelevant to MMORPG games or is it still the same principle? For reference, my Motherboard is an Asus Maximus Hero VII.",
            "jay32267----I've been playing on sata SSDs for years and last fall I got a new machine with an NVMe drive...and as far as gaming...the games load faster but that's about it....there's no added performance in game....but the games I play don't do a lot of loading when I'm playing them. If this were the case....the loading would be faster....and I would imagine it would make a game like that better and quicker.",
            "SkyNetRising----Minimal difference.\nM.2 slot on your operates at PCIE 2.0 x2 speed. It has 4 times less bandwidth than any modern PCIE 3.0 x4 M.2 slot.\nOn your system there's no point in upgrading from sata SSD to M.2 SSD.",
            "LinuxDevice----\nI don't know if the different forms of SSD you are looking at will matter, but many games load only for a given level, and as you cross levels (or trigger new content to be visible), you may see yet another load. Much depends on the game you are speaking of. If you look at the game \"Star Citizen\", then this is very heavily dependent upon a fast disk...it isn't using this for swap if you have enough RAM, but it does use a finer grained \"level\" mechanism, e.g., individual objects might trigger use of the SSD even if you have a lot of RAM. In cases where an SSD matters it is a \"night and day\" comparison (versus using old style hard drives), but whether or not your particular option would be a big difference I don't know.",
            "JerrWolf----\nYeah that seems to be the consensus but I wasn't sure if that also included MMORPGs where the game is constantly loading in information. I see, so while my mother board does have an m.2 slot, it's rather outdated, like the rest of my system lol. I see, I'll just skip the m.2 until the money to build my system from scratch. I see, Star Citizen would be a modern example of the type of games I play (I say modern because the ones I play are 5-10ish years old lol)\nSo in theory, it would help because the game loads a lot more often than the typical game. And I assume outside of gaming, it would also be a benefit.\nProvided my Motherboard was no so old and had an actual good PCIE slot. The drive I was looking to get was; SAMSUNG 970 EVO Plus SSD - M.2 NVMe from Amazon.\nBut I won't waste my money on it if my board won't really utilize it, based on what SkyNet brought up."

So I ask: Do I need a separate backup/archive storage system? I have 4 drives in each of the PC’s in my home office: 2-60GB SSDs in RAID 0 for OS/Programs: Windows 7 Ultimate, Office 2007 Enterprise, Quicken 2010, Nero 10, iTunes, Norton Security Suite, others. Only using about 22GB of space. 1-2TB HDD for data and media libraries: My Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, and Videos, using about 1TB right now. 1-2TB HDD for backups: Windows, Norton, or MS SyncToy. I back up regularly, especially my libraries. Every once in a while I “sync” the two PC together, so all data matches between them. So I actually (may) have 4 copies of my libraries over 4 drives. Yes, redundant! That being said, should I build/purchase a NAS? Or are my current backups enough? I really don’t have the room for another tower, but could for a micro-ATX case. I know they don’ t need a monitor, keyboard, etc. Build it myself, or buy one? How large of storage? I think I answered the question myself, but your input is welcome.",

(1) for me there is value in the backup *not* being direct connected. If anything gets thru my firewalls, it can't destroy the backup too. I backup to external drives then pull the plug. I don't automate backups though, which is my bad. (2) if you have a spare PC, and want to build a NAS then FREENAS might be worth researching. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeNAS (3) A dedicated NAS box might save you enough $$ on electricity and hassle vs. the old PC that it's worth it.

Connect the old HDD to a different mobo port and physically mount it in your machine. Boot into BIOS Setup and check the Boot Priority Sequence.

At the HDD, the wider (15-pin) connector is for power input, and that is done from a connector already part of the wires coming out of the PSU. There should be a spare unused connector like that.

A lot of motherboards have \"IDE\", \"AHCI\" and \"RAID\" for the disk controller - if possible change it to \"AHCI\" (Advanced Host Controller Interface) mode just prior to installing Windows 7. That's the \"native\" mode for SATA drives and it enables some features such as command queuing that IDE doesn't support. I'd also advise you to disconnect ALL OTHER DRIVES except the drive your installing onto and the optical drive you're installing from. Windows 7 will create a 100MB \"System Reserved\" partition to boot from, and if there is any space available on other drives then it will create it on one of those.

The Sandforce chipset has gotten a lot of popularity for performance, but it's reliability is horrible. I've owned 4 OCZ SSD's that were all based on SandForce and all of them BSD'ed on me after 2 weeks. Even with updated firmware. I wouldn't sacrifice reliability for a marginal performance boost. That being said, you really only have 2 choices. The 320 is a great value, but closer to SATA 2.0 speeds. If you want to keep the pace with the fastest SSD's on the market, you'll have to go to the 510 at 120GB which is significantly faster at SATA III speeds. The fastest is the 256GB 510 which runs at near SandForce speeds. So the best value is the 120GB 510. It doubles your 120GB 320 speeds but with only a 25% price increase and still hovers around your R2000 limit (probably slightly over). Just make sure you have SATA III waiting for it.",

I remember doing this sort of thing back in the early 90's with drives, but nowadays the drives are factory calibrated once the PCB's are installed, so it's pretty doubtful. Of course you could always try if you happened to have an identical dead drive where it had failed mechanically and therefor you knew the circuit board was good. I doubt this is the case, and you wouldn't rip a PCB off a working drive to test the theory. Also, removing the PCB would be tricky, sometimes manufacturers use security screws or other tricks to make removal or disassembly of the drive all but impossible. Drives are dirt cheap of course, but this doesn't solve data loss problems. Forensic data recovery is impractical due to its cost.

You got a nice setup there. I also have another RAID 1 set using 2 Hitachi 0A38016 1TB drives. That set is only about 2 months old, so far they have been performing well. The price of the Hitachis is incredibly low. Newegg currently has them for $75.00 and a $10 rebate, hard to resist. I actually purchased another one about a week ago because Newegg had a $10.00 off special, which means that after rebate I paid $55.00 for a 1TB hard drive. I simply could not ignore a deal like that. A good paperweight costs almost that much ;-) I particularly like the Samsungs for their good performance and their being rather quiet for the performance they deliver but, I've heard that filing a warranty claim with Samsung is quite cumbersome. Fortunately I have not had to do so (yet?). If you decide to get a hard drive from Newegg I suggest you torture test it thoroughly. Newegg doesn't pack hard drives very well for shipping and many don't survive the UPS trip. I usually put any hard drive through a 72 hour I/O marathon before I put it into service. One Hitachi I got from Newegg started falling apart after 40 hours of testing. Newegg was great about processing a replacement. HTH."

You need to delete all the volumes on the 1 TB WD Blue in Disk management until the capacity becomes Unallocated and then, simply Create a New Volume. The issue could be caused by a faulty connection/cable, so you should check if you will be able to format it from another SATA port, using a different SATA cable. It might also be a good idea to run both the QUICK &amp; the EXTENDED tests from WD's Data LIfeGuard Diagnostics for Windows to determine the health and SMART status of the WD Blue. Keep me posted with the troubleshooting! SuperSoph_WD",

When you installed Windows on your new WD Blue drive, did you unplug the old WD Green from the system before beginning the installation? If you've got both drives connected to the motherboard while performing a clean install of Windows, you've most likely encountered an OS confusion. Unfortunately, this would require you to begin the installation from scratch again. If that wasn't the case, I'd recommend you to simply try plugging the HDDs to another system and perform the troubleshooting from there. Check if the drives are properly detected by BIOS and how they appear in Disk Management. It's also advisable to test them using WD's Data LifeGuard Diagnostic utility by running both the quick and extended test. It will help us determine the heath and SMART status of the WD Blue and the WD Green, here's a link to the tool: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=32Nt60 If you don't another computer, you can use the DOS version of the tool above and perform the same troubleshooting without booting into an OS.

I'd suggest you to try using a different SATA cable to plug the old drive with, or even a different computer system and see how it will get recognized there. I'm afraid it might be failing, since your system hangs when it's connected. If you have a SATA-to-USB cable or a docking station, I'd also attempt to plug it externally when the OS is already booted.

It would simply be a matter of creating two partitions on the USBEHD, each one large enough to contain the contents of the source disk from each PC. In the event restoration of one (or both) of the source PC(s) would be necessary at some future date because the PC's source drive has become defective or the OS on that drive has become so corrupt that it is no longer functional, the clone residing on the destination disk, i.e., the USB external device, could be used for the recovery process. However... Booting from the cloned disk in this situation could be problematical. It could work...or it might not for one or the other PCs. In any event, regardless of whether none, or one, or both clones would be bootable while installed in the USBEHD it's still an excellent idea to use the USBEHD as the destination disk to contain the cloned contents of the two PCs along the lines noted above.

            "Goozer----Hello and good day. In my quest to better learn and understand technology, I wanted to ask about an issue that I came across with my Seagate Expansion+ 1TB external hard drive. Before I explain what happened, I just want to make clear ahead of time that the small amount of information that I had on the drive is irreplaceable, and it's not worth going to professionals and spend $2,000 on trying to get my data off of it (I had it backed up anyway somewhere else). But basically what happened is that one day I had it and ejected it from my PC, and then pulled it out. Well, the next time I plugged it in, it did not load up, and it began to make the clicking sound of death. I am a big fan of DIY projects, and so I didn't care about breaking the warranty (it was already past it anyway). I opened it up (and I know that I am not supposed to ever open it up and look inside, but like I mentioned before, it wasn't a big deal to do so) and I saw that the arm was stuck on the platter. After looking on YouTube for awhile, I saw someone fix this issue by taking two tools and manually pushing the arm back into place while turning the spindle in the opposite direction. So I did that, but unfortunately it didn't work out. Now my issue is that it no longer seems to be detected. And it makes sounds that I don't fully understand. Instead of trying to explain it, I captured it with my phone in hopes that it would be helpful to more experts on the matter than myself. I noticed that it does tend to blink its blue light at times, but it doesn't last long and it doesn't seem to do anything, but it always made me hopeful. Here is that link - [video=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gdy7bHpmMeU\"][/video] I also have a Inateck USB 3.0 to Hard Drive Docking Station with 2-Port Hub and SD Card Reader, and I even tried putting it into that as well. The docking station seemed to be detected, but not the actual drive inside of it. And it continued to make that clink-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick sound repeatedly, and then sometimes it goes away and then starts up at random times. Here is a link to that video too - [video=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4h0kMAP9Mk\"][/video] So, it's obviously the drive in some sense, but I'm not sure which part is not working correctly.

To answer your question, just because the light blinks and turns on doesn't meant the drive isn't broken.

Your new OS instance doesn't have them. Some programs also deposit files in /windows or /windows/system32. That said, if you continue with the XP install on your new drive you will have to re-install all programs, and might as well just copy all the stuff from the old drive to the new one; an image won't do you any good. =================================================== Now the alternative view. What I wrote above is true for the case where you have re-installed Windows on the new drive. What you could try, if you don't have too much time invested in that OS build, is to abandon what's on the new drive and overwrite it with an image of what's on the old drive. Plugged into the same system, the odds are that it will boot, and whatever was installed will be installed when the image comes over. Which brings me back to your original question: software that will copy a disk image to intermediate media (say that three times fast!). There is no \"right one,\" most of the ones that you see will do this just fine. I'm still using the 2003 version of Norton Ghost, myself. I even have floppies to boot it. Totally random picks: Buy a copy of Acronis True Image, or try EASEUS disk copy - for free ( http://www.easeus.com/disk-copy/ ). From their blurb, \"Copy all of your hard drive: Creating a bootable CD/DVD to copy entire disk.\" I haven't tried it, but watch on the restore option for the chance to create a partition exactly the size of your old one, or to expand it to occupy the whole disk and give you more space. When you say one hard drive space, does that mean you can only attach one, or there is only room in the case for one? If the latter, just have an extra drive hanging out of your case for an hour while you do the transfer. If it's EIDE, you can always put a slave on the same cable. If it's SATA, and the motherboard really only has one SATA port, try something like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812156102&amp;cm_re=ide_to_usb-_-12-156-102-_-Product . Or do it with intermediate DVDs; I'm just too lazy to change that many DVDs. Good luck.",

            "WyomingKnott----I dunno nothing about the current version of Ghost; mine is 8 years old. As I indicated above, I think that the EASEUS freebie will do it. I have never tried this, myself; all my transfers have been disk-to-disk.",

Basically it might be a coincidence. What you could try is low level formatting the drive by using DLG (Data Lifeguard) and run both tests afterwards (Quick and Extended), to see if the same issue occurs. Here's how to do those things: How to low level format or write zeros (full erase) to a WD hard drive or Solid State drive &amp; How to test a drive for problems using Data Lifeguard Diagnostics for Windows. When you run write zeros, make sure that you use \"Full Erase\" Note that the Write Zeros process is data destructive and you should definitely backup any important data which you might have in advance, so that you don't lose anything valuable. Once the Write Zeros process has been completed, the drive would be in a state which is the same as if it was a brand new HDD and this means that you'd have to initialize, partition and format it before you are able to use it: How to initialize or write a signature to a secondary hard drive or Solid State drive in Windows and How to partition and format a WD drive on Windows and Mac OSX. Hope that helps. Please let me know how everything goes.\nBoogieman_WD",

Having said that though, today's faster hard drives should be able to keep up with a typical rendering system. So I would store the video (all data actually) on the hard drive. What you do not want to do is to fill up your SSD to its limits. They need free space to function properly. Basically, a full SSD is an unhappy SSD, which will then lead to an unhappy you. As far as what to buy, I prefer HGST, Toshiba and WD, and in that order. The seem to have the lowest failure rates for hard drives. You will know better than I will about how much capacity you are going to need. Just available hard drive that has 3GB. For some reason 3GB hard drives seem to fail at far higher rates than 2GB or 4GB drives overall. I would also try to get at least a 64MB memory cache, and 7200 RPM drives for this. As far as rendering to the SSD and then copying, I do not think you will see much, if any, benefit from doing that. But that does depend on how fast your rendering program can produce its output. But my understanding is that rendering is slower than just plain capturing a security camera feed. And a hard drive can do that easily. So I would put all of my video on a hard drive or two. Maybe you could put raw video on one hard drive and write the finished output to a second hard drive.",

            "Hawkeye22----I think you answered your own question. \"Windows can't format the system volume on this disk\". Did you have those drives connected when you installed the OS onto the SSD? If so, windows most likely put the boot loader on another drive - the one it won't let you format. If you were to format it you would no longer be able to boot. As a test, disconnect the power from that drive and try to boot. Anyhow, if this is the case, disconnect all but the SSD drive and do a repair install of windows 7. Afterwards, reconnect the remaining drives and see if you can format that drive now.",
            "barbarianhorde----Alrighty I'll give that a shot, I formatted that drive before i installed windows on the SSD, so I figured it would clear the boot loader and all associated parts.. I've never done a repair install, will that essentially be formatting the drive and reinstalling the OS again, or merely doing a repair?",

            "Hawkeye22---- He said he formatted the drive before he installed the OS, so this is not the problem. @OP. even though you formatted the drive, windows like to put the boot loader on a different drive than the OS. If only one drive is installed when installing windows, it's forced to put everything on that single drive. A repair install does not require a format. it should only fix system files.

You can even try it on a different machine. Do you have important data stored on the drive? In case you do and if the drive is not really recognized anywhere even after using different cables, then you could consider contacting a data recovery company.

However, the communication method the new SSD uses is not compatible with what your laptop uses. Your laptop uses the SATA interface to talk with the rest of the system; however, NVMe drives are not backwards compatible with the SATA interface. Bob.B is correct, you're using a type of SSD that is incompatible with your system.

The suggestion was that I pull both drives and set up from scratch or pull the bad drive and just set up the computer as a 500 GB non-RAID computer.

            "John_VanKirk----Hello, &amp; Welcome to Tom's Hardware! Well, it is not that simple. It depends on what kind or RAID you have on your computer. If it's a RAID-1 mirror setup you can detach the second drive and end up with a single volume. If you replace the mirror, you have to replace it with an essentially identical drive. With a single drive, it doesn't end up being a Basic Drive with a standard Partition, it's a Dynamic drive with a simple volume. However you can move all the data off and convert it back to a Baisc MBR partition type. If you have a RAID-0 setup for speed, and remove one, all the data's gone. You can replace it with a different size HDD and it will be OK, but to do that you have to copy off all the data first before setting up the new volume. Lot anymore depends on what your needs are, with the HDD's 1-2 TB SATA-III's being so inexpensive and fast.",

However, when a tech support agent from Samsung wrote back to an inquiry of mine in an e-mail, they gave me a web link, saying Magician is now compatible with Windows 10; this was the link they gave me:\nhttp:// You'll notice on that web page that it's called \"Samsung Data Migration Software\"; is this the \"new name\" for their Magician software? Anyway, I downloaded it, installed it, and when I went to launch the program, the first thing that comes up is a screen saying, \"Samsung Data Migration can migrate your OS and data from your existing storage device to your new Samsung SSD.\" And then there's only one button for me to click labeled \"Start\".

            "Stephen_129----Hi all, Thanks for reading and any assistance. So, I've got a win 7, 2.5\" SATA HDD that I've trying to recover data from. When you plug it into the enclosure, it takes awhile for it to be recognized. The recovery partition is recognized first and is accessible. The primary partition will eventually show up but is not accessible in that when you go to access it, whether in disk Management or just through the GUI in Windows explorer and it will just hang for over three hours (longest I've waited). However, I was able to see that it is RAW format. So even trying to use testdisk, it will just stall on waiting. So it seems to me that it has some bad sectors but I cannot run any chkdsk to attempt a repair since it is in RAW. I did try it on a usb Linux distro and it read! I was able to access and see all the files but unfortunately was not prepared and only had one USB port available so I could not transfer anything. When I got my USB splitter out, of course it would not work again. Oh, and it was from a dropped laptop but the HDD shows no signs of damage other than the issue I've outlined. Again, thanks for reading and any assistance.",
            "Boogieman_WD----Hey there, Stephen. You did pretty well with what you've tried so far. I really do like the Linux option as well, because it tends to help with RAW partitions more often than not. Could you give it a try once again with a different computer without using a USB splitter. If it's not externally powered, it's quite possible for the USB port not be able to power both devices at once.\nIf that doesn't help, since you've already tried data recovery software while booted to Windows, you could try some data recovery tools which have a bootable option, to see if you'd be able to get to those files this way.\nAnd last but not least, unfortunately, if nothing seems to help, you could always go for the professional option and contact a data recovery company. Hope that helps. Good luck!\nBoogieman_WD",
            "Stephen_129---- Hi Boogieman, Thanks for your response. The USB splitter does have an external power supply - nevertheless I did try it on a different machine, minus splitter, with the same result (not able to mount - telling me to run chkdsk on Windows) from Mint. Do you have any recommendations for a data recovery tool that has a boot option? Thanks again.",
            "Boogieman_WD----Unfortunately I won't be able to recommend a specific tool you can use, I can't recommend products and devices, which are not under the WD brand. However, most of the popular data recovery tools have a bootable disk option. If that doesn't help, you could lookup some info on the web about it. Once again, sorry for the inconvenience.",

            "photonboy----1) Endurance is a non-issue here. For one thing you're rarely writing anything anyway. You couldn't wear it out in this fashion ever. 2) It does help LOADING times but be aware it won't make any difference to actual in-game performance. For games like SKYRIM the loading times help a load since you jump around the map or enter dungeons and building frequently but for most other games it's not a big deal. So get the SSD if you want, but a $50 1TB HDD might be a better use of your money. *My suggestion is get a cheaper 120GB or 250GB SSD then use it only for games that really benefit like Skyrim. You can create a 2nd Steam folder just for this SSD and easily move a game from HDD to SSD like THIS: #1 - backup game in Steam\n#2 - Delete local content\n#3 - Restore game but choose the folder on the SSD\n#4 - delete backup (I keep for ones with MODS in case I need to restore Vanilla copy)",
            "doubletake----If you can comfortably afford it, there's no reason not to. Also, as mentioned above, you don't have to worry about endurance since the only time you'll be writing to the drive is when you install a game or new update. The 500GB drive is rated by Samsung to endure about 40GB of writes a day for 22 years . I personally run a 250 evo as my main system drive alongside a 500gb one for games that benefit from quicker load times, and relegate a 2TB drive for every other game in my Steam library that doesn't (mainly single player games).",

            "aRatFlail----Recently I noticed my main hard drive failing and decided to put a fresh installation of Widows 7 onto one of my other drives since, eventually, it was going to go out on me. I put the fresh installation on, moved everything I needed over, and formatted the bad drive. After a few days my computer acted up and crashed on me unexpectedly. Every time I started up the computer would get to the first Windows loading screen and then simply crash. I figured it must have something to do with the bad drive, removed it, and then started to get a message on start-up to 'Reboot and select proper boot device or Insert Boot Media and press any key\". The hard drive containing my operating system was still connected and hadn't shown, before this, any signs of corruption or failure. I'd even tested it along side my other failing drive with Seagate Tools just to be certain and it passed each time! I inserted my USB loaded Windows 7 drive (I used a USB loader to basically make it a 'boot drive') and it didn't recognize it as such. I figured that, perhaps, the drive priority was wrong and went and changed it around so that the OS containing drive was first. Still no luck. I decided to remove the drive and attach it to a spare computer and try and install a fresh Windows 7 on it and, after doing so, found that it would STILL not recognize it as a boot device despite it working on the other computer! After repeated attempts and failure to boot from the USB drive I went ahead and burned a DVD with the installation on it and set the priority to boot from the disc drive. I attempted, repeatedly, to boot from this installation disc with multiple errors and failures that were a result of various missing system files (listed as something like \"/windows/system/[filename]\"), kernels, or even drivers. Pressing enter yielded the option to try and boot something like \"Windows Setup [ECM Enabled]\" or something along those lines but, even if it managed to get to another Windows loading screen, would blue-screen and say I was having a hardware or driver issue. I'm really at my wit's end on this one and I'm looking for ANY ideas on what to do. So far I've tried burning two different installation DVDs with no effect on the main machine other than errors and blue screens. I'm thinking of reinstalling the OS again using the extra computer, but then I'm pretty sure I\"ll be back to the same error message. Any ideas? Questions about my system?

            "Paperdoc----You did a fresh install if Win 7 to a different HDD in your system. I would be that, when you did this, you left other HDD's in the machine still connected and operating - like, your old drive that was failing. I suspect you have been caught by a Windows safety feature! When Win 7 is installed, it looks around the system for any extra HDD's. If it finds one, it places a semi-hidden Partition on that second HDD and stores there some backups of key system files. The idea is that, in future if your C: drive is corrupted, at boot time it will detect this and find the backups on the second HDD. It will restore good copies of them to the C: drive and complete the boot, saving you a lot of worry. The problem this causes,however, is this: EVERY time Windows boots, it looks for that second drive and its backup files. If it can't find them it will not boot! I suspect the backups are on the old drive that failed, so now your system can't find them. How to fix? Disconnect all HDD's in your system except the C: drive. Put your Windows Install CD in the optical drive and boot from it, but do NOT run a normal Install procedure. Look for a Repair Install or something like that. It will find that the key backups are missing AND that there is no second HDD to use, so it will place them on the only HDD available - your C: drive. After the process is finished and your machine can boot successfully from your only HDD, you can shut down and reconnect the other drives. This process slightly reduces the effectiveness of the safety feature design. Now the backups are on the same HDD as the main OS, so if your C: drive fails or is corrupted, the backups may not be of any use. But it will solve your current problem.",

            "masterasia----No easy way. Step1. image the data off to another drive\nStep2. dump your raid-0 Step3. Create your raid-1\nStep4. image your data back Since it was a raid-0 to begin with, Windows saw it as a 2TB partition. When cloning, it may cause some problems because you can't image a 2TB partition to a 1TB partition. Use the Windows 7 disk management utility to try and shrink your partition down as much as you can, the smaller the better. If you can shrink it down so that i can fit on a 1TB partition, it may work. What imaging software are you going to use?\nThe Windows 7 backup and restore utility may work depending on which version of Windows 7 you have. If you have Professional or Ultimate or Enterprise, it has the ability to create a disk image onto a network drive.\nIf you're using something like Acronis, then Raid drivers need to be on the Acronis boot disk for it to work. I would try the Windows 7 imaging tool. I've created images of my raid sets before, but never actually restored an image, but it should work.",

            "masterasia---- Your external HDD doesn't need to be 2TB, but it does need to fit what you've taken up on your current drive right now. So, If your total usage of the drive is about 80GB, your image might be around 60GB. Windows 7 doesn't compress the images down that much. The important thing is how big your partition is right now. When you go to a raid-1, your partition size will be 1TB, so you can only restore a 1TB partition back onto it. Acronis and other tools like Ghost have the ability to put a larger partition back onto a smaller partition, but Windows 7 does not. You should also back your important data before performing this procedure because you'll never know if the image will be bad even if it says it was good after you completed. Also, make your have your Windows 7 DVD or Windows 7 Repair disc handy so you restore the image.",

I was able to install the Corsair Neutron GTX SSD just fine and loaded Windows on it no problem so everything is peaches and cream. Since I am only planning on running the OS and programs from the SSD I bought a 3TB mech HDD that I plan to rip movies to and store all my media etc. I bought the Seagate Barracuda ST3000DM001. After reading on the web I realized the way to utilize the full 3TB of the drive was to format it as a GTP drive. This worked just fine and now Windows can see the full 3TB but the problem is that now the system is getting confused between the SSD and the mech HDD. What I mean by that is that every time I restart the system it goes to the black screen with the blinking cursor because the system is trying to boot from the Seagate vs. the Corsair Neutron. I can't tell you how many times I have went into the BIOS and made sure that the the ONLY boot option available is the SSD, I have tried making it the number 1 option with the other hard drive as number 2 etc...etc...I have tried every configuration and no matter what I do it tries to revert back to the Seagate as the number 1 boot option. Also even when I have the OS booted up on the SSD it runs slowly and gets hung up and applications don't respond. The minute I take the mech HDD out everything runs smoothly again.

            "SuperSoph_WD----Hey there again, weezybaby! I'm sorry for the late reply. I'd recommend you to find another computer and try connecting the hard drive there to see how it will get recognized. You can also try running the HDD diagnostic tests from there as well. If the SMART attributes show the same results, then you should definitely consider RMA-ing the drive as soon as possible. Best of luck! Hope everything works out! SuperSoph_WD"

I'm left wondering if the pads themselves will influence or the Commander Pro. I put it (the commander only, without the pads) on the other side of where my SSD and HDD are currently sitting, so it only has a 1 - 3mm metal wall between them and I really don't want it dangling there.\nAny help is welcome.",

Controller being this product? https://www.newegg.com/corsair-cl-9011110-ww-black/p/N82E16811978004# And those 2 sticky pads are possibly rubberized/flexible magnets - correct? With adhesive on one side to stick to the controller and the other side being \"magnetic\" to cling to the metal wall. The User Guide though refers to the pads as \"Mounting tape\" (see Page 3) and Installation Step 2 (Page 7) uses \"double sided tape. https://www.corsair.com/corsairmedia/sys_master/productcontent/CommanderPRO_Install_Guide.pdf Either way, the sticky pads are likely to be as cheaply made as possible and likely to degrade with time and heat exposure. Mount the controller as you desire but keep an eye on it. Likely to end up dangling sooner or later. Consider mounting the controller using Velcro tape. One strip on the mounting surface, the other on the controller. You will likely only need a couple of small pieces - about the size of the sticky pads that came with the controller. Should make it easier to remove the controller if that becomes necessary. Just my thoughts on the matter.",
            "noxinum----Ye I meant those tapes, but pads came to my mind as of writing that. It's adhesive on both sides, as both sides come with paper and it's written on it, Double coated Tissue Tape.\nThey are probably just some cheap pads but what caught me most off guard was this, Please refrain from mounting the strips on components (HDD, SSD) that are sensitive to magnets. which can be found in that Manual, making me wonder where the magnets are in this. I do have some velcro tabs that came with the pc but are too small to do the whole loop. Might buy the Velco Tape you are mentioning just to be on the safe side",
            "noxinum----I actually found 2 velkro straps that did the job. They were long enough to go around and still have some space to hold the Commander Pro without needing the pads hahaha I just hope there's no magnets to erase my drives that are right behind the Commander Pro.",
            "Ralston18----My thought is that maybe, at one time, magnets were used. Especially those soft, rubbery types often used for refrigerator \"magnets\". Then to cut costs, they went to double sided tape which likely (again being cheap) dried out and failed to hold. Very rare that end user documentation is updated to change, clarify, or correct User Manual instructions. More common to be as broad and as vague as possible to shift blame for any installation problems to the end user. (Cynicism conceded.) Velcro straps (no magnets) should work just fine. However, be sure to occasionally check their condition. The environment (hot, dry, etc.) may cause the straps to deteriorate . Overall, I would not be concerned about very small magnets erasing hard drive data per se. More likely a problem if the magnets eventually lose strength and drop themselves and/or whatever is being held into live circuit boards. Such as the motherboard. Even iron magnets are being cheaply made....."

            "Solandri----If you only have 7 GB free of 115 GB SSD space, that will definitely cause performance problems. SSDs can't overwrite old data with new data. They have to erase the flash memory cell first before they can write new data to it. That erase step is really slow - as slow as or slower than a HDD. To avoid this slowdown, they erase deleted sectors in the background so there will also be plenty of erased flash cells read for super-quick writing. But if you only have 7 GB free, then this reserve of pre-erased cells is not very big, and it's probably frequently being forced to wait to erase cells before it can write new data, which causes slowdowns. Adding a microSD card and moving data off the SSD to the microSD card should definitely help. You should try to keep about 15% of the SSD space free. A bit more for smaller SSDs like yours (about 20%-25% for a 120GB SSD). A bit less for larger SSDs. I would throw in a caution about making sure the microSD card you get has fast 4k random read/write speeds, not just fast sequential speeds. But the SanDisk Extreme Pros are good all-around performers. You want to take care to avoid the terrible microSD and SD cards which have high sequential speeds, but 4k speeds down around 0.05 MB/s.",

Kinda wish I'd bought more (got it when there was a $15 rebate on it). https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XWZWYVP/ Pretty much all SD cards and microSD(HC/XC) are compatible with all devices that take them. The only thing you have to watch out for is that Amazon tends to get a lot of fakes for popular cards. I've had to return a few fakes (subpar performance, stuttering when playing movies off the card, capacity not as labeled). So make sure you test it after you get it (run benchmarks, copy files to it and play movies off it, then fill it to capacity to make sure it takes as much data as advertised). I got my Evo Select when it first came out, before the scammers had had a chance to make fakes. Given that it's been out for a couple years now, you may want to see if you can get it from a retail store like Best Buy whose inventory can't be contaminated as easily as Amazon's."

Depends on what drive your comparing it to, a 7200 compared with an SSHD 5400 they are cheaper and boot faster because the cache is larger. Then you go into power and age of the drive which some of the other guys have said on the forum, which depends if you are trying to conserve power or use it efficiently and whether its an old drive or a new one as 5400s are still being made using more technology, as I mentioned earlier SSHDs.

They should still be good for booting and application-launch though, as latency and random read performance are the most important factors here and even cheap SSDs can do this very well.

If you were to create such a configuration with your current storage devices, you'd be bottlenecking their capacity and speed to the slowest and the smallest drive in the configuration. I'd second @rgd1101's suggestion and use the SSD for your OS and arrange the rest of the storage devices as secondary drives for your data and demanding applications. Don't forget to keep constant backups off-site as well, though. This is the best way to prevent any potential data loss. Even RAID arrays should always be backed up if you decide to upgrade. However, when talking RAID, you should know exactly why you plan to configure it and what would be its storage purpose. Either way, don't forget that you'd need identical HDDs/SSDs with the same speed and capacity in order to configure the array properly. Keep us posted if you have any additional questions!

Once everything is working properly, you can move the Segata data cable to the White SATA_0 connector on the MB. Leave the DVD connected on the Blue connector SATA_3. This sounds basic, but have to ask. The Seagate HDD and the DVD drives also take a special SATA Power connector (15 pins) that go into the back of each drive next to the data cable for power. They can come directly from you PSU or from std Molex 4 pin power adapter connectors. Possibly those aren't connected not giving you power to the drives. Please double check. Then, go into your UEFI BIOS to make some changes. The photo images of your BIOS in the manual are blurred making exact directions difficult, but go to the Storage Settings Page and make sure the Sata 0 and 1 controllers are 'Enhanced', make sure both SATA drives are recognized, and temporarily the DVD is first in Boot order, HDD second. Once Windows is installed, that boot order can be reversed. Hopefully that will get you going.",

If this is for your backup program on your pc you can assign which folder you want it to go to. Just make something like a backup1 folder on one drive and a backup2 folder on the other. You can also use your own backup program to backup folder backup1 to backup2 but this will use your pc/laptop and the files would transfer over your network.",

            "rmiller1959----I ended up sending the drive back for a replacement since I'd had it for only about 10 days. Imagine my frustration when, after reinstalling Windows 7, the new drive started to exhibit similar behavior, i.e., \"disk read error/press control-alt-delete to restart\" or some message indicating bootable media wasn't detected. I noticed that when I rebooted the system, the drive would suddenly not be detected by the BIOS, and it would take frequent restarts before the drive was recognized again and I could boot into the operating system. On a whim, I swapped out the SATA cable with a different one and voila! The drive was detected every time I rebooted and I've had no problems since. I'm still left with two questions: 1) The regular hard drive previously connected to the very same cable exhibited no unusual behavior whatsoever. Is it a coincidence that the cable went bad as soon as I switched to an SSD, or is there something about the characteristics of an SSD that exposed the cable problem? 2) Did the repeated reboots and sporadic connectivity with the first SSD lead to the SMART failure? Or would the drive have functioned normally with the new cable? It's amazing to me that all these headaches and the week of downtime while I waited for the replacement drive were caused by a $5 cable. Lesson learned!",

            "xxbilxx----Hello! I work for a school system and we were having some issues swapping hard drives between identical machines. What we have been doing is swapping the hard drives from one computer, putting them into another computer, and finally renaming them and moving in active directory. A handful of machines we have swapped drives with, however, are failing to boot to Windows. At first, we thought the machines may have been shut down improperly or in the middle of a Windows update, however I believe I have ruled that out. If we put the drives back into the original machine, they will run perfectly fine. When we put the drives in the new machines, however, they refuse to boot -- even in safe mode. This fact makes me believe its not a driver-related issue. Remember, all of the machines (to the best of my knowledge) have the exact same components. Do you think you could offer any possible causes for this problem? Any and all advice is appreciated. I was possibly thinking that the drives in the machines may have different bios revisions or drive firmwares. Other than that, I can't think of anything else. We are hoping we don't have to re-image the machines to get them up-and-running again. Thanks in advance, guys!",

            "Paperdoc----This actually sounds a lot like there IS a difference in the hardware you are not aware of, so that there IS a driver mis-match issue. You could test that by trying to resolve the hypothesized driver issue in the usual way. To do this you need a Windows Install CD for the same Windows version already installed on the HDD. This is being done on an HDD that HAS been installed in another machine and is not booting. With the HDD installed, set the machine's boot priority sequence to use the optical drive first, then the HDD. Place the Install CD in the optical drive, SAVE and EXIT from BIOS setup (if you made any change there) and let it boot from the Install CD. Do NOT do a normal Install Choose a Repair Install which will likely repair any driver mis-matches. When it is finished, remove the Install CD and reboot. If this solves the problem you have fixed one system, and have a good indication that the process will solve similar issues on other machine / HDD combos. If it does NOT, you will know the problem is elsewhere, and you MAY have to replace the HDD in its original machine and repeat the Repair Install to ensure that it has the correct drivers for that original machine. One other possibility comes to mind. In Windows versions beginning with Win 7 (maybe Vista, I'm not sure), the Install process will normally place some key backup files on a SECOND HDD in the system if there is one. After that those files MUST be present for it to boot. If you then took the boot drive ONLY from that machine to another that did NOT have those files on a second drive, it would fail to boot. If you think that is your situation, post back here for a hint on how to resolve.",

            "Paperdoc----A third possibility has struck me. In many systems the SATA port(s) can have their Mode switched between a few options, most notably \"IDE Emulation\" and \"SATA\" or \"AHCI\". If the HDD is in an original machine where it works and its port mode is \"IDE Emulation\", then it is moved to a machine with its port set to another mode, it probably can't be read.

From my research, I've discovered its an M-KEY PCI-E X4. I originally ordered a Samsung 970 EVO which windows nor the device manager would recognize. So I had to send it back.\nBarty1884, recommended 2 different drives that are supposed to work. I have ordered the Or a 512GB WD Black for $150\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/product/wjDzK8/western-digital-black-512gb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-wds512g1x0c\nI am trying to understand what the install process is better. I've read to use a USB Flash drive to put a copy of Windows10 on and change the BIOS to boot from it. However, I do not have a flash drive large enough to hold a System Image. I have a Recovery Disk I've created in the DVD drive, can I boot Windows10 from it? I also have an external USB Drive that has a System Image, can I boot from it? Another alternative might be I also have an internal HHD with an empty Partition, If I placed a System Image in there could I boot from it?\nIt was also recommended to me to use software such as AOMEI Backupper Professional or Macrum Reflect to install my new M.2 once I can get booted to the OS.\nI'm really stuck trying to figure out how to boot from something besides the M.2 I'm trying to replace!\nEDIT: I went back to ASUS website to check on BIOS Updates. To my surprise, there have been 9 BIOS updates from the original one. They start at version 211 and count backwards to Version 202 that was released on 9/14.17. I will go back and verify what version I have and post it! So hears what I found on the System Information page.: BIOS Version/Date / American Megatrends Inc. G751JY, 207, 3/24/15, Then in the SMBIOS column is 2.7 . Now I'm really confused. 2.7 is not one of the update versions listed by ASUS!",
            "srdowns----A few questions:\nWhen you installed the Samsung 970 EVO, was the BIOS able to see it? If it is not seen in the BIOS, Windows will never see it. What BIOS version do you have on your laptop? It should have BIOS version 211. What Windows version do you currently have - 8.1 or 10? The process to clone an existing SSD to a new one is pretty straightforward, but why your laptop did not recognize the 970 EVO needs to be resolved first so that you won't have the same issue with WD SSD.

            "heavyhook----That seems to be the major issue, the BIOS never detected the Evo970! System Info shows SMBOIS Version 2.7 from 3-15-15. That is probably the OEM version because its about a month or two before I purchased my Laptop from ASUS.com. I actually took my laptop to a local PC repair/service to let them install the Evo970. They had it for a couple days hand ran into the same issue I had. I would think they would have tried to update the BOIS. I actually paid them a consultation fee to verify the 970EVO would work in my PC before I ordered it. Then the A-hole was recommending an Evo960. I'm done with them!! I consulted this forum and was given two reasonably priced choices of an M.2 that would be compatible w/ my system.

Here it says the maximum storage capacity support for the device is 4 TBs.\nSo, does that mean: a) I can fit a couple of 4 TB drives in it and use them in RAID1(the usable capacity is 4 TB in total) -or- b) Still the largest drives can be the 2 TB ones as in the case of RAID0 or JBOD. Just one more thing: I know there's a lot going on about WD Red or Black for NAS. I had actually convinced myself on WD Red drives as they are built specifically for NAS but then I've seen people commending the Black drives for their performance. Reliability is of first priority in my case but still I'd be glad having your consideration before purchasing the drives. Thank you..",

The guy I talked to here in Zyxel Turkey spoke of RAID as a mystery He doesn't even know how it works. Zyxel Global on the other hand seems to have issues with their web support system as the queries cannot be sent. So it looks like I'm on my own with this capacity issue. However, with you pointing out the RE4 drives, things turn out to seem more clear to me now. I actually thought the RED drives are perfect for the job in RAID and wasn't bothered with any other drives but it seems with RE4s having TLER as well, plus spinning at 7200 rpm rather than 5400, they are even better. I mean the only drawback is that they are more expensive In fact I cannot understand why the RED drives are announced as the most RAID environment friendly drives(or are they?) Am I missing something? If not I am really going to opt for the 2 TB RE4s. And the largest RE4s are 2 TB so the capacity issue with my NAS will be solved as well One more thing. I've seen that some of these RE4s are stated being for enterprise while the product code being the same for all(WD2003FYYS). I mean is there an enterprise RE4 2 TB and a non-enterprise RE4 2 TB?",
            "Emerald----RE and RE4 drives where designed for Enterprise RAID where high access time is necessary. REDs are test only in NAS environments where the slowest link is the NIC and therefore the 5400 rpm is enough and it creates less heat",
            "ser7ach----So, with the gigabit interface of my NAS device RE4s will perform better than REDs right?\nAnd you mean there is no such thing as non-enterprise RE4 right, there is only one model?\nHeat and noise is not much of a concern to me by the way, the box has a very good and silent fan and I'm keeping it away from where I work anyways."

            "liquidsnake1989----Dear community, For a project we're going to build a server with a bunch of storage. We're going to store CCTV captured video's on it. After some considerations I came to the following build. Some components we already had lying around and we would like to use them. We're going to use 2x 256GB SSD's in RAID-1 for the OS and the video surveillance software. Then we have a RAID-6 array with 9x 4TB SATA disks (the WD RE ones), for a (theoretical) total storage of 28TB. So a total of 11 disks. I've found a 2U 19\" rack chassis which can house an ATX motherboard, and it has 12 hot-swappable drive bays with a backplane. The backplane gets connected with 12 SAS or SATA cables. The chosen motherboard has 3x PCI-E x8 slots and a PCI-E x16 slot, together with some x2 and x1 slots. At first I was aiming at purchasing 2 RAID controlers with 2x SFF-8087 connectors each. That way I can use two SFF-8087 ports of one RAID controller, and one port of the other controller. When using 3x SFF-8087 to 4x SATA cables, it totals on 12 drives. But then I read somewhere else here on Tom's that a RAID controller only 'sees' the drives that are physically connected to it. So in other words I would only be able to connect 8 drives to the first controller, and the two SSD's to the other controller. I would not be able to make a RAID-6 array with 9 (or 10) disks. So that brings me to the question, what RAID controller should I use? I've seen tons of RAID controllers so far but they ALL had some sort of drawback (not compatible, not supported, wrong interface, wrong connectors/ports, etc). The components I had already chosen are:\nMotherboard: http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/Xeon/C600/X10DRL-i.cfm\nRAID Controller: 2x http://www.lsi.com/products/raid-controllers/pages/3ware-sas-9750-8i.aspx#tab/tab2\nSSD's: 2x Samsung 850 Pro 256GB\nHDD's: 9x WD RE 4, 4TB (http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=580#Tab3, type 'WD4000FYYZ') I've left out other parts which are not important for this question (PSU, RAM, CPU, etc) So to wrap it all up, 1) Is it (still) true that a RAID controller can only 'see' its 'own' connected hard drives?\n2) If that's true, what RAID controller would be advised for this situation? There are some restrictions to the RAID controller. It should be connected to the motherboard with a PCI-E x8 slot (or x16), it has to be low-profile and has to have SFF-8087 connectors. Thanks a lot for your input",

            "liquidsnake1989---- That could be a nice 'workaround', but not a good solution I'm afraid. You see, up until now we've always managed to 'work around' the problem by using solutions such as a NAS, or use 'standard' solutions like HP or Dell or Huawei servers. But we would really like to build up some knowledge on how to do it yourself. It might not be the perfectly balanced build the first couple of times but that's a concequence of learning, right? So although I appreciate your suggestion we're really looking for an 'ín-chassis' solution. As for performance requirements, well, its a constant stream of video data that gets send to the hard drives. I'm not yet sure how much MB/sec or Mbit/sec that requires, but the Dell and HP servers we've used for other solutions seem to manage just fine, and they are also just 7200RPM SATA/SAS drives.",
            "kanewolf----I guess I don't see how using commercial solutions is working around the problem. Picking your parts from HP (or Dell) configurations is no different than picking from the entire spectrum of parts. Except that you don't have any engineering except what you do to justify your parts choices. A NAS created volumes using iSCSI over 10GE is no-more of a workaround than putting disks in a chassis in my opinion. My experience has been in a large corporation so I may not be as cost sensitive. But to me, labor hours in standing up a home built solution cost more in the long run than do commercial solutions.",
            "liquidsnake1989----  I understand your point. But let me put it this way. I just want to learn how to do it. And yes, there's a (big) chance that eventually we will decide to just go for more 'out-of-the-box' solutions such as HP, Dell or other products. But for now we just want to try it for ourselves and get familiar with how it all works. I've been building my own PC's for the last 13 years now. That does not mean that everytime we need a client/workstation for something, I build it myself, but I am very grateful for the knowledge I got by doing to myself as well, over the years. "

The power will come from a small power supply unit that will also power the optical drive along with 2 fans.

When turinng the pc on there was a spark and turns out the cable from my corsair commander pro that was plugged into a usb header on my mobo wasnt plugged in all the way and it shorted out killing the commander pro. I got a new one today and installed. All is good except now my HDD and SSHD are not being recognized no matter how many cables or sata slots I try. My boot drive(ssd) is working fine so whats the deal here? They are not showing up in the bios, windows disk management, or under the cmd prompt to display them. What should I try next? Is it even possible to fry them? Also, I tried the sata cable that the ssd is using on them and it didnt work. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! And lastly, is there a way to get what was on them back or transfer the data to a new drive? It was really games and pictures.",

There was only the 2 TB hard drive, and I also checked the SATA ports on the motherboard, and I also only found one SATA cable connected to the motherboard. I called for a replacement, because the desktop didn't have a SSD. However, the replacement arrived, and there was still only a single hard drive, and a single SATA cable...\nI've never actually turned the PC on, because I was planning on just removing the SSD and replacing it with the one I have right now, and then setting the one I have right now as the boot up hard drive, so as to not need to reinstall anything.

After inserting a different hard drive, I got the same results. Fan and heat sink were a little dirty so I figure he fried his CPU, which is soldered into the board.\nSo I stuck his hard drive into a different unit and tried to boot to it. Nope.

Foolishly, I ran it on ALL of my drives: HDD, ODD and Local Disk (C). I used the default file erasure method which said \"British\" something something \"(Enhanced)(3 passes) at least that's what I could remember from it. After running it my computer desktop turned blank green and I think it was green because that's the colour I set my desktop to before setting a wallpaper (I'm running Windows 10 btw). This led me to believe that all of my stuff had been deleted since my desktop appeared blank - my computer was frozen however and I couldn't do anything. Next, my computer ends up at this page http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PctFo1mVwus/VLNz-41mynI/AAAAAAAAD9Q/DAIOw2kDQ-g/s1600/%D8%BA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%81.jpg with the same error. I don't remember if there was anything else on that screen but upon reaching 100% it stuck there - I wasn't sure if it was meant to do this or not so I pressed the restart button on my PC, rebooting the PC. That was when I was confronted with the message: \"reboot and select proper boot device or insert boot media in selected boot device and press a key\".\nI therefore went into the BIOS, and saw that my main HDD was in place after the ODD which had an arrow pointing to the HDD underneath Boot Priority (I run Asus so my BIOS may be different to some). So I switched them around and now my HDD is first in boot priority, with an arrow pointing to my ODD. Also in Advanced Mode in Boot Option Priorities, my Boot Option #1 is my HDD and #2 us the ODD. So it seems as if my computer should be working alright but when I click Save Changes and Reset it comes up with that message still....really really frustrating, I'm worried that something has gone wrong with my PC from running that program in the way that I did. ﻿",

There are only a very small handful of apps still on my C Drive (Skype, Photoshop, etc.) yet it still finds a way to climb back up to no free space.

I clear out the temporary files which sometimes fixes the issue, but this isn't really helpful. I've downloaded Wiztree which shows how much space each file in your drive takes up, nothing stood out there.

            "DDroid----Hello all, I would like to install a M.2 or NVMe SSD using a PCIe adapter on my Asus M5 A97 R2.0 Motherboard, since I am out of SATA ports. I have a free PCIe slot, so I am sure I can do this, however, I was wondering if the adapter I purchase really matters. I am looking at a PCIe x4 M.2 adapter. I am not sure what x4 really means. Also, Will the adapter reduce the SSD speed? I have read multiple opinions, some users say it does and some other that it does not. Or perhaps it has got to do with the SSD model? I am also contemplating booting the system with this SSD. Thank you for your kind comments!",

Booting from one may or may not be possible on your motherboard.\nSupport for this was very spotty in the Z97 era. What other storage devices do you have?\nThe difference between NVMe and SATA III SSDs is not as great as people assume. Especially on older systems.",

( I saw a video where someone used double sided tape to add an extra SATA SSD to his PC but I honestly did not find it practical nor convenient )",

(That depends entirely on what CPU/Motherboard you have) Many M.2 slots have direct access to the CPU. It certainly won't hurt to have additional drives in the system. Only if you exceeded the DMI bandwidth would it be a real problem and that should be hard to do under normal circumstances.",

If everything tries to run at once there are still potential problems. Though on newer platforms that is as much as a 4x PCIe 3.0 interface. As for direct access to the CPU, that depends on the CPU and motherboard in question. High end Intel boards usually have one M.2 direct to CPU and others going through the chipset. For once they offered more lanes than most boards needed to run dual graphics cards, so they used the excess for the M.2 slot. I know the block diagram disagrees, but excepting boards that support three-way crossfire they can be wired that way and many are. (Though I can't say much for SLI or Crossfire these days) For AMD, not so much. They have left some general purpose lanes, but I think the great range of CPU support leads them to basically ignore it and use the chipset for everything.",

I had accepted the Win10 upgrade and over several months and after a couple of crashes where I \"lost\" the start button, I decided to revert to Win7. I added a Samsung SSD as my boot drive (drive C) and loaded Win7 onto it and the machine boots fine and I have Win7 back as my OS. I then went into disk management and wanted to combine everything on the Toshiba drive to one large partition. I used DISKPART and did the CLEAN ALL command since I could not combine partitions in disk management. I then created a partition (named D) and all seemed well. My Disk Management tool now tells me that I have this drive as Disk 1, it is a Basic disk, it is online and healthy. It has one primary partition and it is active, BUT it is only 746.52 GB NTFS.

I don't think there is a BIOS update, the last official one I think was 2009, and I'm probably running it. idk. I will go run it and see if I see any options.

But even if there was a way to get the PCI or PCIe to run it, even as a boot, I still fear it would cause me some issues. So I think I'm close to giving up on the idea, maybe not totally, if you have any further clarification about PCI vs PCIe boot on herethat would be interesting. Thanks! I will go check the BIOS...yeah don't see anything. So should I just go for EVO 850, or is that going to outperform I/O speed of SATA II somehow? Meaning, should I get something cheaper than EVO, because SATA II is bottleneck? I guess I can go read this somewhere... But if you know please tell. But thanks again, I'm getting closer!"

I'm trying to use the Windows 8.1 Image Backup software to create another total drive image of my Primary C: over to my D: Drive. I made an image just fine when I first got 8.1 up and running w/ drivers installed. It's been awhile now(2 months), and I've since installed software/updates and a few games.

When I click \"refresh\" on the HDD section, it just searches for a split-second and re-highlights Network Backup. The drive itself has been running fine, it has my games installed plus the original image is still there. Only other thing is this is my new system, and I've been trying to get OC settings tweaked in. At some point during OC trials/tests, I did get an error saying my Recycle Bin was corrupt on D:, and I've since fixed that, read about some method online to \"reset\" it.

            "1LiquidPC----Nope, still doesn't work. Also, ackoman, has this by chance happened just recently to you as well? I'm curious if it's due to a Windows update. On an even stranger side note(why I'm chalking it up ATM as a faulty Windows update)is my other PC is doing the exact same thing now in Windows 7. It's showing \"removable disk\" as the only option under the harddrive section in the system image software which is referring to the card reader hub built into my monitor. The last image for my Windows 7 PC was in June, so haven't made one in a while. Same story here, though. Other than a new mouse, 2-3 games, and Windows updates and standard AV updates, nothing else has changed. I have music/games installed on the secondary drive(same internal drive my last successful image is on)which run fine. Listening to some music on drive now as I'm typing this. My new PC parts that I've been testing are what I made this original post for, running Windows 8.1 on those. Again, with 2 different systems, both have backup system images that created fine, and now neither will create new images to secondary internal drives. Other than not being able to do this, they're both running fine. A few more things to point out is that there is plenty of space on the secondary drives to write images too, so that's not the problem. Also as some web searches suggest is to make sure the partitions aren't \"active\", which they aren't. Just single Primary partitions spanning the entire drives on both systems. Starting to wonder if more people are seeing this behavior too?",
            "1LiquidPC----Figured it out! After some more web browsing I found the answer on a post right here on Tomshardware. Making an image on my Win 7 machine as I'm typing. It turned out to be Origin's fault. Which I have installed on both machines, but actually made the image on my Win 8.1 machine before installing Origin. The post I found had someone with a similar situation with games, click on post if you want to read http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-1790553/windows-create-system-image-boot-hdd.html They had games installed as well on a secondary drive but the Image software wouldn't let them backup. Turns out its something to do with how certain Windows services can get installed with games, if the services themselves point to any other drive than C:, it can cause the problem as Windows will flag it as a system drive, hence not allowing secondary drive as backup. In my case I installed both Steam and Origin clients along with games themselves on my D Drive. When looking through the services, I seen that while Steam client service was on C:, Origin Client was pointing to D:. Both clients I installed to D in the first place, but it looks like Steam \"knows how to integrate properly\". With this knowledge, I looked up how to backup my games, copied the Game Folders to my desktop, uninstalled Origin. After uninstalling, I reinstalled Origin, this time putting it on C:, but pointed the game install directory back to D: where I wanted it. Next I just copied the game folder into the \"new\" Origin Games folder. Finally, fired up Origin again, and it did a file verification, then the game loaded back up fine. After all this, I loaded up the Backup &amp; Restore software, clicked Create a System Image, and low and behold, my secondary drive loaded right up and I was able to create a new image. Hope this is helpful information to anyone else seeing this problem. Just to summarize, in my case it happened to be Origin itself, but it can be a single game, as mentioned in the post I linked to. Keep an eye on your running services and where they're pointing too. Learn something new every time on the forums here "

When booting up my PC with the old SSD connected, the computer takes about a minute to get past the motherboard logo screen compared to ~3 seconds usually. When I booted from my good SSD with the bad one connected (it had been a long time since I had booted with the bad one connected), I was able to see the bad SSD and its files. I opened up cmd and ran sfc /scannow /offbootdir=e:\\ /offwindir=e:\\windows It was stuck at beginning scan for a long time, but eventually started checking things. I don't remember exactly what it said, but it had seen something wrong and was trying to fix it. However, I noticed it had stopped, and used diskpart to see that the volume was no longer listed as well as the disk. I restarted, but it was still gone. I've found that the only way to get my PC to recognize it for even a little while is to shutdown my PC and then turn power supply off and then on. Next time, I tried running chkdsk e:\\ /f /r It started scanning stuff but then froze on \"Examining file name linkage\". Again, after a while it failed because the disk was no longer recognized. If I boot from a USB and use diskpart, list disk shows the bad SSD there. However, list vol does not list any volumes for it. I believe the problem lies entirely with the SSD because I have no issues with using my other one.\nDoes anyone know any causes for these problems and possible solutions?\nThank you.

Only benchmarking programs and moving LARGE amounts of files really benefit from having the faster storage of NVMe.

Usually not as big of a difference compared to another 250gb of storage.",

I had the same question last year, prior to my build, and went with the same drive...850 EVO. General consensus is that for standard use...games, average productivity, web browsing, multimedia, etc. you won't notice any difference. If you are going to be working with a lot of very large files, or transfering large amounts of data around regularly, you would probably see the difference. In terms of general use...my laptop as NVMe and in benchmarks it crushes the 850 EVO...but for most consumers, who don't worry about benchmarks, they'd never know the difference as boot times, application loading times, and responsiveness both seem the same. It's not like the difference between SSD (SATA or PCIe/NVMe) and HDD...where it is definitely noticeable. That being said, if my budget didn't limit me to choosing between the 2 I'd go for NVMe of course",

The Evo is slower but cheaper. You can get away with an HDD for a data drive, but the price of the Samsung 850 Evo SATA SSD is coming down, and again, the speed is worth it (and once again, if you can afford the 850 Pro, go that way...). I have a 256GB Samsung 850 Pro SATA SSD for my C:\\ drive and a 1TB Samsung 960 Pro m.2 NVMe as my data drive (backed up by 2x 1TB HDDs). Yeah, that's backwards, but I was promised by Dell that their motherboard supported boot from the NVMe socket, and it sort of does...unless you're running Win10 Insider Preview and trying to run Ubuntu on Windows Subsytem for Linux.

If your PC is going to be used for professional work, saving/extracting/transferring enormous file sizes, and the like, where time is of the essence, then, yes, the NVMe (PCIe x4) SSD drive may be worth it. On the other hand, if your PC is just going to be used for casual work, some gaming, boot drive, and the like, then, the SATA-based SSD wins over price/performance as the difference in time/speed versus the NVMe is only about a few seconds.

What I'm wondering is, would it be best for me to keep Windows Superfetch/Prefetch enabled as is the default, or should I disable these services and allow the SSHD's built-in Adaptive Memory Technology do all the work? Or are there some custom settings I should set for Super/Pre-Fetching (say, only for boot) that would optimize performance without sacrificing the lifetime of my drive? I know that on pure SSD's it is always recommended to disable superfetch and prefetch, but I'm unsure about this hybrid drive with such a small SSD cache. Would keeping prefetching on reduce the life of the drive in some way like it would a SSD? Will it enhance or decrease performance, boot-time, application loading, etc., or somehow interfere with Seagate's Adaptive Memory Tech?",

But Seagate has since taken down the page, so I have to take it on the word of others that their even used to be a Seagate page saying so! Basically what I'm wondering is, when the SSHD already has Adaptive Memory Tech, will Superfetch simply add to the unnecessary burdens being placed on the Processor and the Drive, or will it possibly even DECREASE performance by interfering with the built-in Adaptive Memory Tech? Or, will it help improve Application Loading and Boot times? I can't seem to get an answer from Seagate or HP on this issue, so I'm coming to you guys on this site for answers.",

            "jpe1701----Hi there, So I ordered a mydigitalssd sbx 512gb pcie 3.0 x2 nvme ssd. It was on sale for $149 and my second m.2 slot only accepts pcie drives. It is a Ryzen x370 board so the second slot is pcie 2.0 x4. I am confused about how it will work. Since pcie 3.0x2 and pcie 2.0x4 use the same bandwidth will I get full speed? Or will it be halved to pcie 2.0x2?",
            "feelinfroggy777----PCIe 3.0 x2 = PCIe 2.0 x4 So you will get full speed of the SSD. If you had gotten a PCIe 3.0 x4, then you would only get half speed.",
            "jpe1701---- Well my only concern is that the controller is set up to use 2 lanes so wouldn't that reduce it to pcie 2.0x2 speeds?",
            "mikewinddale----My suspicion is that you'll only get PCIe 2.0x2 speeds. Even though PCIE 3.0x2 and 2.0x4 have the same bandwidth, they operate in different ways. 3.0x2 is narrow and fast, while 2.0x4 is wide and slow. If you plug an SSD that is narrow and fast into a slot that is wide and slow, the signal is going to have to operate at the lowest common denominators. In this case, the lowest common denominator is 2.0x2. I think a 3.0x4 in a 2.0x4 slot would operate at 2.0x4, while a 3.0x2 in a 2.0x2 will operate at 2.0x2. But that's just my guess. I've never tested this out.",

            "jr1228----Latest Update: Even some newly downloaded files that I path directly to the new drive either don't open or only open with some glitches or corrupted spots. I think I purchased a bad drive here and it is a case of my own stupidity. It was on a bit of a sale but the price was high enough that I didn't think it would be an issue, but I believe I have made a dumb purchase this time around. Update to include some additional information:\nThe laptop helping to connect the external drives to talk to each other is an old ASUS X556UAK model from 2017. Version 10.0.19045 Build 19045\nIntel i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50 GHz and 8GB memory\nIt's running Windows 10 Home The old external drive (where all the files work as intended) is a Western Digital passport. I believe it is 07A8 as this is what its properties tells me and images seem to reflect this when I search for it. The new thumb drive is Wasisen which, admittedly, I have not heard of and perhaps I got a bad brand here. Additional info I noticed that may be helpful: Even among the files that transferred \"successfully\" to the thumb drive from the passport, not all of those files will open or activate. The ones that do will show the same thumbnail that the files on the passport drive show. The ones that don't just show generic application thumbnails associated with the files. Upon unplugging and replugging the new thumb drive, Windows detects errors. I allow it to repair the drive, which it does. This does not cause the problematic files that did transfer to activate. However, if I move/replace some of those files again, this time they will open fine as they would have if they had been copied successfully the first time. This doesn't apply to the files it simply refuses to take, but it does replace the \"unusable\" ones it copied over with successful versions now that Windows repaired the errors. The drive had errors yesterday too, but I didn't try to recopy files that wouldn't open then as I did today. Perhaps the new drive (the USB thumb drive) is bad, although it is transfering some but not all data. I can try to put some of this data on another WD passport that I have and see if it goes over without issues. I don't have an independent hub to try this without using the computer as an interface, but I did use a USB cable to transfer files to the tablet in the past, so perhaps I'll just have to stick with that method. End update Hi everyone, I recently purchased a 1tb USB C thumb drive to make it easier to move some content from my laptop to my tablet. This mostly works fine, but there are some files that are getting the above error message. The computer claims that it cannot read the file from the source disk. In this case it is a separate external hard drive. It's one of the \"0x\" error messages but I don't recall the full one just now. I'm writing because it has given me the same error today as I am currently trying to copy the files again for a second time. The message will probably pop up again soon because the problem appears to be specific files. Out of about 1,300 small-ish files, around 100 or so had this problem yesterday, When I got the drive, it was exFAT, which I did not change. The other drive is NTFS. I thought perhaps this could be the issue, so I reformatted the new thumb drive to be NTFS as well. Sadly, today it runs into the same problem with the same files regardless. I thought it would be corrupted file data, which would make sense. However, the files open/display/play without any problems or glitches. The files work, so I am not sure if it could be corruption. The computer lists no errors in the drive that it needs to fix when I scan it. Although, this doesn't necessarily mean the drive is not somehow damaged, I suppose. The drive on which the data exists now is several years old. I've tried to rework the permissions on the files as some posts on the internet said that might help, but to no avail. The files are not hidden or blocked. I thought perhaps the new drive was the issue, but these problematic files typically can't be copied to a different location (like somewhere in C drive) or deleted either--although perhaps I could do this on a fresh restart of the system, I've not yet tried. The problem persists if I boot in safe mode and try it that way as well. This has happened with a few much newer files (from the past few days or so) as well, but I can't figure out what might be the cause. I thought it was just somewhat old files that might have some corruption despite seeming to work fine. What the system can or cannot copy over seems to be random, at least to an average user like myself. When the drive reaches the point where it gives me the exact error message number I will update this in case that might be relevant. I guess I could just leave the small number of files on the old drive, but I was hoping to copy full folders and remove that data. Since it can also happen with newer files, I'm not sure that's a great solution anyway. Thank you for reading, and I'd very much appreciate any suggestions.",

For now I have an old Nvidia QuadroFX card until I buy a new one. Using the mobo HDMI for main monitor and Quadro for a second monitor. Also installed Lucid Virtu but don't think it is doing anything. Seagate was the original drive and gave good boot times for HDD. Got the m4 and step 1 I upgraded to the latest 309 firmware. I then installed windows on M4. I have to do the double install method since my copy of windows 7 is an upgrade copy. So either i install my xp copy and then install 7 on top, or install 7 once and then again. I still do the custom(clean) install, so this isn't an upgrade install, but because of double install I get a windows.old folder which I just deleted. After the install, I formatted my seagate to get rid of windows and everything else on it. Deleted the 100mb partition, but that just made it unallocated space. I dont' care for it. My first issue was once the m4 had windows, the new 100mb partition showed up as a drive in my computer. So I had 3 drives in my computer, m4, 100mb partition and seagate. So I reinstalled windows again and this time 100mb partition was hidden. I initially had seagate in IDE mode, but I switched to AHCI right before installing windows on m4. I see the ahci driver load after bios screen real quick and as ssd shows iostor for M4 which I believe is the intel ahci driver. My total boot time to being able to use my mouse is 90 seconds. 30 seconds to get to windows '4 circle logo' and a full minute from then to be able to use windows. This includes mouse circle load thing. Honestly this doesn't seem any better than my seagate was performing during boot. AS SSD bench looked alright, 490ish read, 175mb/s write.

That's the way it works with the Windows Office programs. You don't have to install the prior version if you wish to do a clean install.",
            "HelixLegion----Yes. There is no option to enter an old disk or old key with Windows 7 installation. If you just do a clean install on a clean hard drive, the key is invalid. Basically, Windows knows that it is an upgrade key and it is expecting to see a previous version of Windows already installed on the hard drive. So you have to double install and the 2nd time Windows accepts the key. Anyway, my bootup is even worse today taking close to 3 mins on multiple tries. It simply hangs at the 'starting windows' screen for a good 45 seconds before doing the 4 circle animation. Then the screen goes black for a bit before blue windows screen shows up with mouse circle for sometime. Finally desktop shows up after all that. I had a tv tuner installed but I uninstalled the drivers for it so media center can't see it anymore, but this hasn't helped.",
            "Meganano---- Can somebody confirm or refute this? If it's true I'd be inclined to avoid Windows upgrades and wait for Windows 10. At least they didn't make you install DOS first.",
            "HelixLegion----Update for anyone else who may face this. I also had a USB external HD connected and I disconnectd that and total boot time went from 3 mins down to 45 seconds. Everything is pretty fast now until after windows 4 circle animation. I still get stuck at the blue windows screen for a good 15 seconds with mouse circle spinning. I think I should be able to get that a bit faster with some tweaks but the main culprit is the external HD."

            "russianheman----Hello, I built a new system with a seagate barracuda SATA HDD and ASRock A780LM motherboard. After a few weeks of working beautifully, my primary HDD crashed. BIOS wouldn't recognize it. So I returned it just fine. The replacement drive came and BIOS acknowledged the drive on the first boot. I attempted to install Windows but Windows did not detect the drive. It did, however, detect my secondary drive. I rebooted. Then all of the sudden on the first reboot, BIOS no longer detected the new drive! I could see the secondary drive fine though. Same problem twice in a row! Do I need to replace my HDD again although BIOS detects my other drive? Or is the problem somehow connected to the motherboard--corrupting my HDD firmware or a failed BIOS chip?",
            "treefrog07----It is unusual for two failed HDDs, but it does happen. Since the board finds your other HDD, it is not likely the board is bad. Have you tried connecting the HDD to another SATA connection? Each of the free connectors? You may want to [color=ff0000]flash your BIOS to the latest version, here, 1/2 way down the page[/color].",

Temporarily transfer the connectors from the secondary hard drive to the new one, then boot up. Does the system detect the new drive properly this way? If it does, the dive is OK and you have a problem either in the data cable, the power supply cable, or the mobo port that were ORIGINALLY connected to the new drive. If it does not work the new drive is faulty.",
            "russianheman----but is it possible that the motherboard is corrupting the HDD firmware, causing the drive to fail?",
            "Paperdoc----I suppose that might be possible, although it is more likely something like an overload on a HDD circuit board, and not a corruption of the drive's firmware. Anyway, I think that is very unlikely. Try the swap test I suggested to see if the new drive actually works that way.If is does not, I'd still be inclined to agree with treefrog07 - 2 bad drives is more likely than some of the other things."

First I need to know: 1) Is the SSD connected correctly. I have been told by some to connect it to the ICH10R Serial ATA 3.0 Gb/s (Black Colored Connectors) instead first. After doing the install of Windows 7 to move it back to the Marvell Serial ATA 6.0 Gb/s. I was told to do this because one person said they got 3 to 4 blue screens on their Sabertooth x58 when trying to install Windows on the Marvell Serial ATA 6.0 Gb/s connector. Only once this person connected their SSD to the ICH10R Serial ATA 3.0 Gb/s they had no problems and simply switched the connectors back to Marvell Serial ATA 6.0 Gb/s after the installation was finished. 2) Other then going into the BIOS and ensuring AHCI mode is enabled before installation is there anything else I need to do before installing Windows 7 Professional 64 bit?",

I would probably do the install on an Intel SATA II port and then see how it does on the Marvell port. Just make a System Repair Disk after doing the install in case you need it to correct the srp data.

But both of them use USB 3.0, so what exactly makes the difference in performance of these two if any? What other properties of external hard drive that determines their performance? I'm choosing between these two:\nWD My Book\nWD My Passport Ultra",
            "casper1973----My Passport drives are designed to be portable. They use 2.5\" (laptop) hard drives and are powered entirely through a USB connection so are very easy to carry around and use on the fly. My Book drives are designed for \"desktop\" use (ie. not being moved very often). They use full sized 3.5\" hard drives and usually require a mains power connection. You usually get better performance from desktop drives, but at the sacrifice of portability. Between these two drives there isn't going to be a huge difference since they both use 5400RPM hard drives. It really just depends on how you are using it - portable or not.",
            "jossrik----External drives are just internal drives with a box and an interface. The larger WD probably has a 3.5 in drive while the smaller of the two has a 2.5 in drive. Differences are the same as with internals, one or both are probably 5200 RPM drives. I would expect that's the main difference. More 3.5s are 7200 than the smaller drives which are normally 5200, some lower than that. Shouldn't have too much of an effect on performance though, which is to say, both will be adequate, neither blazing fast, but then, you probably don't need blazing fast transfer speeds.",

If my primary Hard Drive has Windows Vista installed on it and I wanted a second hard drive with Windows XP on it (and I didn't want to partition my main harddrive), what would I do and would this produce any complications with my main hard drive's state. ",
            "440bx----Skip to point 6 below to ensure your BIOS supports a convenient way of booting from multiple hard drives. If it does not then I wouldn't bother. The simplest and safest way to do what you want without any complications is: 1. Disconnect your current drive that is the home of Windows Vista.\n2. Connect the second drive as the only drive in the system.\n3. Install Windows XP as if it were the only OS in the machine (since the other drive is disconnected at this time, the Windows XP installation will in fact be the only OS in the machine, though temporarily).\n4. Configure XP as needed e.g drivers, programs, and whatever else you want.\n5. Reconnect your original primary drive (the one with Windows Vista)\n6. As long as the motherboard you've got gives you a boot menu facility, you will be able to boot from either drive. If the motherboard does not offer a boot menu facility, then it - hopefully - gives you the option to select which drive to boot from in the \"boot\" section of the BIOS. If neither of those options are available to you (some cheap boards don't allow you to specify which hard drive to boot from) then it is a hassle, you'll have to physically swap the connections between the drives to switch which one becomes the boot drive (too much hassle IMHO). HTH.\n",
            "ahnilated----Most operating systems allow for 2 different os's to be installed and use a boot menu to select which one you want to boot into. I have Vista and Windows 7 installed and can select which OS I want to boot from with the menu. Windows XP will allow you to pick the HD you want to install to and then it should also see the other OS installed and give you a boot menu. You can also go into Windows and select which OS you want to be the default boot OS.",
            "440bx---- You are correct but, that works when both OSs are installed on the SAME drive. If the OSs you want to choose from are installed on different physical drives - which is his case - then BIOS support is need to first select _which_ drive to boot from and then, which installation from the selected drive (which is done by the Windows boot loader as you explained). ASUS, Gigabyte and a lot of other manufacturers have a boot menu option at startup to select which drive/device to boot from. Cheaper motherboard models tend to omit this feature however. HTH",
            "jitpublisher----^ Yeah, I did the dual boot thing for a while with XP and Vista on different drives.\nYou add both drives as bootable, and then there is another option you can set that brings up a menu during boot for you to select which OS you want to boot to.\nAfter a while, I just got tired of it, decided there was really no advantage to having 2 OS's, so you know what I did? I formatted the drive with Vista and went back to using XP. I am not saying there is anything wrong with Vista, I just can't figure out why so many think they need it! 64 bit Vista is nice if you need a lot of RAM. But there are very, very few people who actually need more than 4 gig of RAM. And the catch is, the only real reason to have more 4 gig for most users, is because they are running Vista!\n32 bit Vista is.....well, you might as well have stuck with XP. Oh yeah, DX10, I forgot about that. Well, when I was running Vista 64, DX10 did not impress me all that much. Could not tell much, if any difference over DX9 with all the eye candy turned up. Well, no difference except that it ran a lot slower......."

I have looked this topic online but i could not find any recent reviews. So i thought the \"issues\" may have changed since the larger drives now are so much more inexpensive compared to what they used to be. For me i am trying to decide do i go with (a)a single 1TB NVe M.2 card (b) or a 500GB NVe M.2 card and a 500GB STATA SSD drive. I was going to go with just option (a) and call it a day buy my wife asked if we should have two smaller ones instead of 1 big one. I thought about this and i can think of pros and cons to both. Assume in both cases backups are done on somewhat regular basis. Since i dont understand the raid setups i just do automate backups. I just wanted to pose this question to make sure i have thought of everything...........in my opinion.......and it may not be a goodone which is why i am posing this question.........if i am doing regular backups...........does it really matter if i have only a single drive?

After that the drive still appears in Active@ Partition Manager but now the \"Initialize\" option is greyed out , I tried reinstalling the drive from device manager but still no success. Trying to initialize through windows Disk Management says \"The system cannot find the file specified\".

            "crlf----Hi. So I had three harddrives. One 13GB WD from 1999, a 60GB IBM from 2001 (both IDE), and a newer 640 GB WD SATA from December last year. I have a very outdated computer with an Asus P4B533-V so I had to use an SATA/IDE converter. Everything worked fine for 6 months until a couple days ago, when my computer froze for about a minute (when I wasn't even doing anything) and I could hear my harddrive(s) making noise and the HD indicator light was on. Maybe 30 minutes after that I went away for a bit and came back, and saw a black screen that said \"Press any key to reboot\". When I rebooted, I saw that my 13 gb and 60 gb's were not being regonized in bios. Since I had Windows installed on the 13 gb I couldn't load Windows. I tried using my Windows XP cd to reinstall Windows on my 640 gb but it kept telling me the drive was corrupt or not partitioned properly and that it was only aprox 131,000 MB. I found out the original Windows XP can't detect harddrives larger than 130gb~, so I've already burned a new XP cd with SP2 sideslipped in. Anyway, I bought a new 500 GB HD SATA to replace it, only to discover apparently you can't have two SATA drives on the same cable, so I'm currently sending it back and buying a new IDE. But my question is, could two harddrives just fail at the same time like that? I tried switching the IDE cables and trying them on different controllers, and even independently neither is being regonized by BIOS. I thought maybe it was the power supply, but everything else seems to work ok, including my two CD drives which were both plugged in (although not connected to any IDE controller).",

Without special treatment, SSDs in RAID will become slow since the disk is getting 100% full; you should never allow an SSD to get that full. The only remedy is secure erase on both SSD and setup RAID again (if you still want to).

Then, I learned that B450 motherboard supports AMD StoreMI. From what I learned, StoreMI basically turned all of your drives into a large and fast SSHD, which is a great thing since that means I can make game loads much faster, too. However, I realized that my CPU is Ryzen 5 1500X. So, I'm a bit concerned that StoreMI wouldn't work. So, here are my questions: Is it true that StoreMI does what I said? Or are there any limitations to that?\nIf my 1500X is placed on B450 motherboard, can StoreMI still work?\nHow big of an SSD do you think I should buy?\n",

You can't just replace one of them, without a full reinstall of ALL data. Minimal performance? The claims of speeding up the whole thing is a bit misleading.\nIt cannot speed up reads from the HDD. Physics. The only data that is \"fast\" is that which actually lives on the SSD.\nGiven a large enough SSD, that should be most of your day to day data anyway. Rendering the StoreMi irrelevant. It is a good concept, in theory. But in the face of dropping SSD prices...a concept that is increasingly not needed."

            "JMLow54----I recently completed an analysis of my HDD drives, in particular the file sizes currently there, and still to be added. One factor, is that the sector size is set at the factory and is static. Where the benefit comes in though is cluster size. I've experienced improvements in read/write times by tweaking the cluster size allocated at HDD format. So far, because of time to save/restore and other impacts to time, I've only increased the cluster size to 8192. However, it would really save time if I knew where the break-over point was. I know that there is a point of diminishing returns, I just don't know what that is. Of course, FORMAT permits a maximum cluster size of 64K. I know the threshold for cost/performance ratio decline is somewhere between 8192 and 64K. What I don't know is, do the following factors have to be examined and adjustments made as well to get the best price/performance ratio from the format of the drive? 1) Memory capacity?\n2) CPU power/speed?\n3) BUS speed?\n4) Drivers?\n5) A combination of two or more listed?\n6) Something not listed? I do know that how new the HDD's are, also plays a part along with the version of SATA in use (which the drives must accommodate). My rig has the following features:\nA) AMD 4GHz 8-core processor.\nB) 16GB DDR3 2133\nC) SATA III (though HDD drives have not yet been updated fully. Only 2 of the bank support SATA III speeds.)\nD) ASUS SABERTOOTH 990FX GEN3 R2.0 mobo (board had to be hardened due to environment it operates) As to capacity, there is a total (among 5 internal) HDD capacity of 8.5TB (gross). As to file sizes, two of the drives are at capacity now (4TB &amp; 2TB) and those were analyzed. Average file size is 8.7GB, with max at 48GB and min at 2.7GB. As data is captured, written then used later, the speed of retrieval becomes important. I don't wish to tweak a lot of different settings either in BIOS or Windows 7 at this point, I want to start at the hardware level that can find a good balance between capacity utilization and I/O. Any guidance is greatly appreciated.",

IF you had software that ONLY read or wrote in 64KB chunks you could improve performance. But desktop software and even most server software is not written with an emphasis on efficient I/O. Databases and a few other types of commercial software can be tuned. Custom software can be tuned. If you want performance, SSDs or RAM disks are what you need to think about. Mechanical HDDs won't perform.",

            "CBender----You will you a 6700k with a 1080 as a nas, really? If you are indeed using it as a NAS (which is a complete waste of money or you don't exactly understand what NAS is) you would need a thumb drive for the NAS operating system and as many hdd as possible. Now if by NAS you mean that you will use the system for gaming/work/everyday and then stream some movie from to another medium, then you have to go with the smaller ssd and the 1tb drive. Since depending your needs 500gb of storage can go way to fast these days around.",

            "JackNaylorPE----SSD Boot time = 15.6 seconds\n7200 rpm enthusiast HD Boot Time = 21.2 seconds\nSSD Boot time = 16.5 seconds Those were recorded on our test box which has (2) SSDs, (2) SSHDs and a HD. System had fresh install of OS installed on the three different storage devices and which one was booted was determined by BIOS selection of boot device. With games AAA titles going from 40 to 95 GB these days, SSD storage of games is not feasible for most budgets. My recommendation would be the smaller 240 GB SSD SSD with a 2 TB 73200 rpm SSHD. That being said, the advantages of each in its role as an NAS will be gimped by network speed which since you described it as an NAS, it's not the speed of the storage device which will determine loading speed, but the ability of the data to travel over the network. NAS however is not really the correct term if I am understanding your planned usage. For example, the box I am typing from a CAD Workstation in my Home Office. It also serves as: a) CAD Workstation make great gaming boxes as GTX cards lead the pack in both usages.\nb) Office network storage. All the office boxes have their files stored on this PC\nc) Home network storage. All the home boxes do their data backups to this PC\nd) Media Server. All movies, music etc is stored on this PC for both office and home users. Basically ... an NAS is a storage only device with no ability to do anything itself with the files stored upon it. In essence, your Gaming PC is also serving as a Data Server. I would suggest: SSD to boot your OS and Programs\nSSHD to store your Games, Data\nEventually a 2nd SSD to store backups of the other 2 in case one goes south."

After installing the new PSU, the PC boots OK, goes to the BIOS and I see no drives there, I used to have a SSD and HDD. After a bit of digging on the reason why this was happening, I discovered that I made the mistake of reusing the old Corsair power cables that powered my drives, with the new PSU I acquired. After examining the distribution of the sockets, yup, they are different. Then I smelled a strong burnt plastic smell from the SSD. So, it's safe to say that I fried both my drives right?, I then changed the cable for the proper one, tried a different SSD that I had somewhere and it was recognized by the BIOS just fine. Also tried both those drives on a different PC and they are indeed dead. Just curious as to why on earth would the standards change, and fry drives in the process. #pissedoff.",

So if a drive gets fried from excessive voltage levels (by using the wrong cables), there is also a good chance that the motherboard's sata controller gets also fried or damaged in the process. I think you are extremely lucky. As for the sound card. You must test it extensively in order to come to the conclusion that it's fine. The fact that it shows up in windows is a good sign but not a definitive one."

            "sutton.don48----I lost access to my Dlink DNS323 enclosure and the left drive light no longer lights. The setup software will still find the enclosure and I can perform operations on the drives so I think the drives (Raid 1) format are OK but for some reason there appears to be a fault with the enclosure. I recently installed another router in the network after the previous Netgear router refused to allow internet access although at the time everything was still visible on the network behind the router. The replacement router is a Dlink DSR 250N which has shifted the IP numbers xxx.xxx.xx.nn to xxx.xxx.xx.nnn. I am wondering if this might be a firewall issue as all items on the network are DHCP with the router being the DNS server. The DNS323 is quite old and early this year I upgraded the drives from 500GB to 1TB. I bought a QNAP TS231 which was on special and copied all wanted files from the 500GB while functioning to a partition on my PC before replacing the drives in the DNS323. The DNS323 has been functioning fine until the router malfunction. I am at a loss for the next step.\nIf I can't get the DNS323 to go online again how do I get the data off the drives? (it is just data since the 500GB ones were replaced with the 1TB drives so not a lot of data but enough to make it a nuisance. Can the drive/s be mounted in a PC running Linux Mint access them? Can I use a USB connected SATA housing to access them?",
            "DR_Luke----Assuming that the drives are healthy, you should be able to access that data on them via Linux, yes. However, with the chance that the drives are failing, it is probably best to get a full sector-by-sector image (Guide to ddrescue) of each drive to a known healthy drive before you try anything. If the drives are setup RAID 1, either drive (preferably the clone) should give access to the data, but there is a chance that one was offline longer than the other, resulting in outdated data. So, be sure to verify that the most current documents you are looking for are present and open. If the drives are setup RAID 0, you will need both drives (preferably the clones) working and accessible in order to rejoin the stripe set. It may be easier to not bother trying to mount the RAID, rather just use a data recovery program to virtually rejoin the two and give access to recover the data out to another drive. Good luck.",

I shut it down then reinserted the Volume 1 drive and rebooted. I found I had access to the drive from Windows. I already have a copy of the 500GB drive as I backed this up before fitting the new 1TB drives earlier this year. Boyed with idea that this has worked I thoght I will replace the Volume 1 drive with the 1TB drive and see if I can read that. Failed and drive not visible to either Windows or Linux. You can still access the enclosure with the web based setup tool and I used this to do a scan of the 1TB drive with a success result. It is baffling why neither Windows or Linux can access the drive even though it is visible by the setup program. As it stands now Volume 1 Right side facing front of enclosure 1TB drive the one I want to get the data off. Volume 2 is a 500GB drive reformatted with the conversion from raid 1 to standard and one of a pair of the original data drives. The setup reports both drives as file system standard and are formatted as ext 2 file system. The left side drive LED still does not light up and now suspect that this may be cactus. Wondering if I will have to put both 1TB drives back in and see what happens.

In generally the 840pro and 840evo is the same basic performing drive... but if you deal with big files or want a large SSD, the pro will be a better option. *as a disclaimer, know that i do own a 840 EVO, however i have used both, and did extensive research on both drives prior to buying the evo last xmas.",

Also, I know I shouldn't have done this but, the damage has already been done. It started a few weeks ago. My Windows was updating and after about 4-5 hours I was met with a black screen and nothing was happening when pressing any button and I said \"screw it\", so I unplugged the PC. Then upon boot, Windows was trying to revert the whole update and after about 10-20 minutes I was met with the same black screen so I unplugged it again and that was the biggest mistake. I tried installing Windows again on the same HDD but it just didn't work, because when it reached a certain point during installation, it would reboot. I got another HDD and installed windows on that. 1) I looked in \"This PC\", the HDD isn't there.\n2) I installed AOMEI Partition Assistant and I get an error if I try to initialize the disk: Sorry, the current operation has been canceled!\nInformation Code: 45\nDescription:Failed to initialize this disk. What does the Information Code mean? Please refer to: https://www.diskpart.com/help/errorcode.html 3) When trying to convert the disk to GPT using AOMEI, I get this error: Sorry, the current operation has been canceled!\nInformation Code: 6\nDescription:The partition table on the disk was failed to update as the partition table is being locked by other programs, please close other programs and retry.

Where I live it's pretty common to have sudden blackouts (yup, it sucks) and everytime I had an old HDD (plain white sticker, unlike the colored ones of today), it fails after 2-3 blackouts. Honestly, if you have to shut off the PC forcibly, do so through the power button. Hold it until the PC shuts off completely, might take bit longer than you think. That way, the software (OS) is killed abruptly, but the hardware and power aren't. You might corrupt the data, but you'll spare the hardware. At most, your Windows drive (and programs running at that moment) is corrupted, but I figure it's better than killing the drive itself. At least downloading applications is practically free compared to replacing drives. The dead drives that I had always exhibited the same symptoms: either undetected through Diskpart or other softwares, constantly failing chkdsk or most recovery/diagnostic from other softwares, or flat out not showing up in BIOS despite being powered and spinning.",

The best way to see whether the HDD is faulty or there is something wrong with your system is to just attach the drive to another computer.\nIf the issue persists, then I guess the drive is faulty. You can just contact the retailer and eventually RMA it. You can contact WD's Support either by e-mail or phone on that as well.

            "shanecallanan----I've read some articles about Silent Data Corruption across SATA channels.\nApparently there are some mechanisms in SATA HDDs to prevent (or at least reduce) the rate of SDC.\nWhat is this mechanism, and can I rely on it?\nDo I need to worry about SDC in a 100TB storage array for instance? My intention is to build such an array and write to it only once, although I expect circumstances will arise where I'll need to do additional writing (so to be safe, I'd like to plan for 500TB of writing and then read from then on). If SDC could be an issue for me, how would you suggest I overcome it?",
            "fzabkar----You could switch to a file system that checksums the data and metadata, eg BTRFS, ZFS.",
            "Ralston18----I really do not have a direct answer to offer. However, there are always going to be issues and there will also always be \"solutions\" for those issues. Be they real issues or marketing hype. You should always worry and you should always have multiple backup and recovery plans in place.",
            "shanecallanan----It looks like there are specially-configured hard drives with 520-byte sectors (512 bytes of data, 8 bytes checksum) which can test/correct for SDC, but these are quite expensive. In terms of whether SDC over SATA is something I need to worry about in a 100TB storage array, here is a table showing the frequency of such errors: { \"lightbox_close\": \"Close\", \"lightbox_next\": \"Next\", \"lightbox_previous\": \"Previous\", \"lightbox_error\": \"The requested content cannot be loaded. Please try again later.\", \"lightbox_start_slideshow\": \"Start slideshow\", \"lightbox_stop_slideshow\": \"Stop slideshow\", \"lightbox_full_screen\": \"Full screen\", \"lightbox_thumbnails\": \"Thumbnails\", \"lightbox_download\": \"Download\", \"lightbox_share\": \"Share\", \"lightbox_zoom\": \"Zoom\", \"lightbox_new_window\": \"New window\", \"lightbox_toggle_sidebar\": \"Toggle sidebar\" } Across the SATA channel, the typical error rate is 10E17, or 1 error per 11PB (max) of information transferred.\nAt a consistent transfer rate of 0.5GB/s, it's possible to transfer 15.7PB of data per year which would result in at least 1.4 errors.\nGiven that I aim to write only about 500TB of new data over the lifetime of the drives (4.5% the error rate), it doesn't seem worthwhile protecting against it.\nEspecially since ZFS can't protect against SDC when initially writing to the drives (see here).\nTherefore it's far more likely that an SDC would occur during reading of files, which isn't a major issue since the data will not be affected. Does this seem reasonable? I'd like to be clear that my analysis ONLY factors for SDC rates over SATA channel.\nIt does not account for for single-bit errors in RAM, hard error rates of the drives, potential RAID rebuilds etc. Therefore - based on my research over the last few days - the need for a solution like ZFS is imperative when working with a 100TB array and data integrity is important to you.\nIt's also clear to me that SATA drives are not reliable enough above 10TB, never mind 100TB. SAS drives are necessary instead, but this is outside the scope of this thread. Thanks for pointing me to ZFS @fzabkar .\nAlso @Ralston18 yep I'm considering backup/contingency plans.\nThis is early days for me. First DIY file-server build so all this is new to me.\nBut I'm learning!",

I want to keep all my files on my 700 gb hdd, but my new computer will need to be a 64 bit OS, so I plan on installing the new OS on the ssd and booting from it, and just use the hdd to hold everything else. I've read many articles about using the two drives but I still want to keep the OS on the HDD incase anything happens. Main question... If I install an OS on the SSD, and leave everything on the current HDD, will it still work? By work i mean can i change the directory right over to the HDD to the same place I currently use.",
            "WyomingKnott----Well, no, it won't work the way I understand your description. I'm not quite sure what your last sentence means, but see if these address it\n1) You must disconnect the hard drive before installing the OS on the SSD. Otherwise, you will boot from the hard drive and then transfer control to the SSD.\n2) Read SSD tweaks. You _must_ put the drive controller in AHCI mode before installing your OS on the SSD. Then, you will find, you can't boot from the HDD. Since it's an in-case, this doesn't need to be fixed; just change controller modes back if you need to fallback.\n3) You cannot run software installed on the HDD when you are booted from the SSD. Installation writes entries to the registry, and the SSD installation will have its own. Ditto some \"common files\" areas. You will have to re-install almost everything in the instance of the OS that is on the SSD.\n4) While you can access files on the HDD when booted from the SSD, you will find that access controls are messed up. If a file is owned by the login \"brian\" now, it will not be owned by the login \"brian\" on your SSD boot. So make a system backup of your HDD, store it in a safe place, and go wild. You can boot from the SSD and, should that fail, fall back to booting from the HDD. Let us know if you have more detailed questions about, say, why to remove the HDD while installing to the SSD, file ownership, or things that I haven't touched on.",
            "blackmancer----you can install the OS onto the SSD and leave everything on the old HDD (most programs will not work tho, need to be reinstalled), just disconnect the HDD before you install the OS on the SSD. Once the OS is installed, reconnect the HDD and copy your old files over. Just double check the Boot Order in the BIOS so the SSD is selected first.",
            "brian911----Okayy... That is the majority of my question answered. One last one. When you say you have to re-install in the instance of the os on the ssd.... That means, First I need to be booted in the OS on the SSD, and then I just have to remove the program on the HDD, and re-install it again on the HDD just basically while on the SSD OS?",
            "WyomingKnott----Nope. No reason to un-install it. Think of it this way\n1) Put the HDD in a desk drawer. Connect the SSD\n2) Boot from the installation disc and install the OS to the SSD.\n3) Install games, utilities, and anything that you love to the SSD.\n4) Connect the HDD and use it as a data disc. No need to uninstall anything from the HDD. You can't do that while booted to the SSD; you can only change your HDD OS while booted to the HDD. And if you remove stuff from the HDD, you can't use the HDD as a fallback as you described. If, after building the OS on the SSD, you don't have SSD room to install everything, you could install some of your larger applications on the HDD. They will load more slowly. If the installation process prompts for a directory, just pick one on the HDD. Otherwise, it requires a registry tweak"

Not only do you lose space to formatting, but space is also set aside for cells that are expected to fail. You can expect ~90% usable space once the drive is ready to go. Yes this IS a form of cheating (since the drive is essentially unusable without formatting), but since everyone does it by the same amount, its not really a big deal.",
            "funnyman06----As bdcrlsn was saying, when HD manufactures claim HD size they estimate with 1000MB/GB, 1000GB/TB, 1000KB/MB etc... But in the real world we know that there are 1024 B in a KB, 1024 KB in a MB, so on and so forth. That is what you are seeing, you're not loosing HD space, its just a difference in definition."

As you've already been told, there's no increase in game performance, the game will just load faster compared to installing it on an HDD. Good FPS rates depends on the capabilities of other components (GPU, CPU etc), not the storage medium.

Mirroring is implemented (without striping), so the two disks are exact duplicates of one another. I want to eliminate the FastTrack I/O controller and continue to use XP on just one of the two disks. Will XP continue to run ok if I -- 1- Remove the FastTrack card from the computer\n2- Remove one disk drive from the computer\n3- Attach the data cable of the remaining drive to the SATA data plug on the motherboard There are two concerns here -- 1. Will XP recognize the new I/O port on the motherboard ok (even though it has the Promise Tech FastTrack driver installed? 2. Will this work ok in view of Microsoft's software forbidding system changes (eg, Windows Genuine Advantage, Product Activation technology, and the Registry) ? Thank you for your advice. ",

As far as Microsoft's anti-piracy software, that is a function of how Product Activation technology works (as per this description --http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Product_Activation#During_activation).

I found that you can disconnect either of the two drives, then connect the remaining one to the motherboard, and it boots Windows fine. So I was able to remove the RAID card without any problems. BTW, I also discovered that the RAID card ONLY does its job if you have the proper Promise driver for it installed in your OS. If you don't, the RAID card looks merely like a standard onboard sata port to your disk drive. For example, I booted a Live Linux CD and found the Promise card just operated like standard mobo sata ports. Thanks for your feedback."

Another general rule is that the larger the capacity of the drive the better the performance when it's nearly full. So a 120GB drive that is 80% full will work better than a 60GB drive that is 80% full. Run a benchmark right after you install Windows and your motherboard drivers. Keep it as a baseline and run another one after you've installed the rest of your programs. You can then compare the 2 benchmarks and see what kind of performance hit (if any) you've taken. You've already purchased your SSD so it's too late, but there are benchmarks with the new OCZ Vertex 4 that just came out last week with the drive at 100% capacity with hardly no loss of performance.

Look at the Intel X25-M 80GB SSDs, you really only need one for the OS + applications. All data files should be on large mechanical disks. The lower the rpm, the better for this task.

The Intel ICHxR RAID drivers are of high quality and can enable write caching for RAM-speed write speeds for short bursts, which improves performance.

            "SuperSoph_WD----Welcome to the TH community, Frazze! This seems like quite an annoying issue for you! I'd recommend you to test the WD Blue drive in your laptop using WD's Data LifeGuard Diagnostics for Windows. Running the QUICK and EXTENDED tests should help us determine the health and SMART status of the drive. Another thing you could try is disabling some Windows Services that could also be the source of the issue. If there's anything wrong with the HDD, I'd recommend you to get in touch with the laptop manufacturer's customer support and ask for assistance, since it's a brand new product. Keep me posted, though. SuperSoph_WD",

I also tried to disable some Windows services (Superfetch, Windows Search and Background inteligent transfer service) as suggested in the other thread but the 100% usage spikes and lags still persist. I've found more topics with 100% hdd usage issues, but in most cases, the hdd usage is constantly at 100%. Mine HDD seems to be just fine most of the time (few other games don't lag and all), it only apears on certain applications and at random intervals (or they're not random at all, because something causes them, I just don't know what).",

For example: Right click on \"My computer\" can cause this lag too with exactly the same D: drive usage spike. (it doesn't happen everytime i right-click my computer) My hardrive was also set to power itself off after 20 minutes of inactivity in Power plan settings. I set it to \"Never\", but it wasn't the solution obviously, because the lags persist. I spent a lot of time watching processes and their usage and it doesn't seem that one process can cause this. Every process has 1% HDD usage at max. Thank you.",
            "SuperSoph_WD----Hey there again, Frazze! I'm sorry for the late reply, I was taking some time off. It seems like the issue is becoming quite annoying. How is the performance of the drive overall? Does the system experience any lags or freezes?\nThe last resort would be to backup all your precious data and clean install Windows from scratch. This should automatically rule out any software that could be the source of the issue. It could be Windows 10 itself as well. It's not an uncommon issue with this OS version after all. Let me know how the troubleshooting is going. SuperSoph_WD"

Do you have any data stored on that hard drive or is it a new laptop?\nAnother thing that might also help is resetting BIOS to its default settings through the interface.

If the HDD is sometimes detected, then the issue could be coming from the SATA connector on the laptop or the HDD itself.

I currently have Windows Vista 64-bit running and I would like to move everything in one action to the new SATA drive, remove the IDE HDD, let the BIOS move down the boot sequence chain to the SATA drive and function as if nothing happened other than the speed of access. Any suggestions on how to do this without the tedious process of re-installing Vista, applying the service packs and settings? The utilities I see that boast easy transfer require re-installation of the OS and the transfer program to restore the image.

I think most pros use Norton Ghost to do what you want -- personally I found early versions kinda confusing but that was a long time ago.

HDD RAID 0 According to the youtube video i linked, Raid 0 hdd speeds approach those of SSD speeds in load times for games, but this is the only video i can find approaching the subject. And not much information is given. Is he using 7200rpm drives or 10000rpm velociraptor drives. 512GB SSD as cache means that since its just for gaming, and with cached information being so small, it would take a very long time before those cached items are rewritten/booted out. so after the first run of any map/level on a game, i should be getting SSD speeds from then on for months if not years. But if im going to do an SSD cache, it seems RAID 0 would be unnecessary given that, again according to the video, it nearly approaches SSD speeds and would offer even greater marginal differences in performance. so in order of price to performance it seems: 1. HDD RAID 0\n2. 512GB SSD as cache for a _ TB HDD\n3. 512GB SSD as cache for 2 X ___TB HDD (RAID 0)\n4. 2TB SSD (~230) this is all assuming all the above information is correct. hell with the left over money i can even configure a raid 5 system if i wish to (not that i will given the likelihood of drive failure isn't any greater than normal) im writing this as both an mini PSA as well as asking or advice, which it seems i tend to do a lot on this sub.",

Sure enough, the drive was not listed under the Computer tab. I don't have an extra SATA cable lying around but I did switch the connections with my CD ROM and verified that the drive still didn't work and the CD ROM did. The HDD also spins when initially powered up. If the drive is dead, that's fine by me.

Furthermore, RAID0 fails at the square of the number of drives times the failure rate of one drive. So lets say 1 drive wil fail in 1 year 0.2% of the time. 2 in RAID0 will fail in 0.8% of the time in one year. 3 in RAID0 will fail 1.8% of the time, and 4 will fail in 3.2% of the time in 1 year. Which if you do the math is 16 times the rate 1 will fail. RAID0 isn't really the most reliable setup with more then 2 drives. That's why there are other types of RAID. Throw in the fact you won't really notice any end user use improvements and you've got a questionable plan in your head. That said... any INTEL raid controller will work flawlessly with your plan.",

            "jackperry----Hi all, So... I have three hard drives. One SSD which is my OS drive, one which I install games on and also download tv shows to, and the last one which houses organized media for Plex (tv shows, movies, anime, etc). Normally transferring a download from the second drive to the Plex drive takes a few seconds, maybe five seconds max unless it's a big file size, those could take maybe 15-20. However in the past few days, even small transfers (300MB) are taking minutes, even with TeraCopy. Larger files (1GB+) are taking 5-10 minutes. I've tried TeraCopy, regular Explorer, I've checked all of my drives using HDTune and CrystalDriveInfo and they all say healthy. Even generating thumbnails or even right-clicking to rename a video file is lagging. I'm at a loss for what is going on. Any ideas? I'd really like to not have to get a new drive as backing the media up will take forever since it's so slow.",
            "Solandri----Worst case: The drive is dying. Use SMART tools to see if the drive is generating an excessive number of read/write errors. If it is, backup your data ASAP and replace the drive. Best case: Are you using bittorrent to download TV shows? Fire up a disk defragment tool and analyze the drive. I'm betting it's horribly fragmented. Most bittorrent apps have an option to allocate the entire file when you begin downloading, but it's disabled by default. Without this option, each piece of the file you download gets written to the first available spot on the disk. By the time the entire file is downloaded, it's fragmented into 3000 or so pieces. This means the read/write heads have to move all over to read the file, pausing with each move. If the file weren't fragmented it could read it as one sequential transfer at 100+ MB/s. But fragmented like this, reads will slow down to a few MB/sec. First step is to defragment the drive. Depending on the size and free space, it may be better to copy the game files to another drive (I assume they were written to the drive while it was still relatively unfragmented, so they should copy fairly quickly). Then delete them to clear up space for the defrag tool to work. Do the same with any downloaded shows which have finished - the more space you can clear up, the faster the defrag will go. Optionally, you can just delete them if you think it'll be faster to re-download them. A delete only changes a single byte at the beginning of the file, so is really quick. Once the disk is clear of everything but files you can't remove (in-progress downloads), run the defragger. Note that this means you have to exit the bittorrent app, otherwise it will prevent the defragger from moving files it's currently downloading. When the defrag is completed, you can copy the game files and whatever else back to the drive. (I'd actually recommend putting the game files elsewhere - the drive you use for torrent downloads should only be used for torrent downloads precisely to localize problems like this to only bittorrent.) Last is the most important step. Find the option in your bittorrent program to pre-allocate the file when you begin downloading, and enable it. The only time this should not be enabled is if you're downloading to a SSD (which doesn't suffer a slowdown from file fragmentation).",
            "jackperry---- Solandri, Thank you so much for the detailed response. You're right, I am using bittorrent and my games do not seem to suffer this problem. To give some insight, the disk I torrent on also houses my games and old backups that don't really get touched. That said, it is a 2TB (1.81) drive, with 1.01 used, and 825GB free. Is that too much to run defrag as it is? I should still move everything off of it? What about the fact that even AFTER the files are transferred to my Plex drive, renaming and thumbnail generation is much slower than it was before as well. Is this possibly a side effect of the nature of the drive? It didn't seem this slow before, it seems to have started when the slow copying started.",
            "Solandri----\nIf it's only half full, it should be ok to just skip straight to the defrag. WIth 1 TB of data, expect it to take a while. Run it overnight. Can't think of a reason why that would be related to the torrent drive slowing down. Normally thumbnails are stored in a hidden file in the same folder as the file. Filenames are stored on the HDD (both your Plex drive in this case). So it should be completely unrelated to your slow drive. You can try having the defragger analyze your Plex drive as well. Maybe you've got excessive fragmentation there as well. You can also check if your thumbnail cache has been disabled. Standard warnings about being careful before messing with the registry apply (make a manual restore checkpoint if you're unsure).\nhttp://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/10794-thumbnail-cache-enable-disable.html If you've got a huge number of media files in one folder, that can slow things down as well. Try sorting things into subfolders, if Plex allows. It's also possible Windows is deleting your thumbnail cache too frequently. This is sort of a give-and-take situation. More frequent deletions and rebuilds means more accuracy (fewer files without thumbnails). But it also means longer to rebuild the thumbnails in a folder. Separating out the files into different folders will help prevent this. It's also possible to disable Windows' penchant for deleting the thumbnail file. I do not know what the side effects of doing this would be though.\nhttp://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/stopprevent-windows-7-from-deleting-thumbnail-cache/",

However, if the USB flash drive is not recognized, you can try a few things, to see if you'll be able to access it.

Install CrystalDiskInfo and make sure it reports the drive is healthy.\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/134735/how-to-see-if-your-hard-drive-is-dying If it's not healthy, back up all your data ASAP, then report back to us. If it is healthy, how full is the drive? For SSDs you should aim to keep about 15%-25% of the drive empty. For HDDs aim for about 10% free. Once you drop below these thresholds, you should begin deleting unneeded files, moving files to external storage, or replace the drive with a bigger one. Once you've got at least 15% free space (25% is better), try defragmenting the drive.

            "BretAB----Hi Tom'sHardware, A little background first: “Wear Leveling Count” is a S.M.A.R.T. attribute of SSDs. It’s Attribute# 177 and, “… indicates the difference (in percent) of the most worn block and the least worn block.” In more practical terms, it’s one of several indicators of how worn out an SSD is. The wear leveling attribute of most manufacturers is stated as a percentage of 100 (with 100 being a new SSD). For example, a 92 would mean it's 8% used/depleted/worn. That said . . . Periodically I take screen shots of the SMART Attribute data of some of my critical drives. I use the (imho) great open source app GSmartControl to display the attributes. A couple weeks ago, I took a shot of an 860 EVO 250GB (Model MZ-76E250) put in service early in 2018. I saw an odd number “12” in the Wear leveling Count attribute (ie. attribute # 177). Then I compared that screen shot to a couple others I made since 2018. I found that attribute moved from the “0” I noted when it was new in 2018, to the “12” I saw on 11/20/19. It was “0” at first, then went to “2” several months later, then to “10” months later, and the 11/20/19 number “12”. It’s been a couple weeks since 11/20 so I looked today and I see it’s “13”. Here’s a couple pics of the drive specs and attribute data:\nOops, \"Insert Image\" not working in this forum (\"Something went wrong, please try again or contact the administrator\"), so here's the link:\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!ArzLg8uNtUZ3iDkobDEa65_ybbmq\nand\nhttps://1drv.ms/u/s!ArzLg8uNtUZ3iDrbBltbwKpZpBR5?e=59bCLM The drive is still under warranty so I decide to ask Samsung support about their unusual #177 numbers. Sounds easy enough right? You won’t believe the brick wall that I ran into on this. On 11/20 I submitted the support case online. Basically it was the “Periodically I take screenshots…” paragraph above. Later that day I received a reply, “Please provide a screenshot or picture of the information you are seeing under your SMART attributes.” I pasted two pics seen above the html email and sent it on its way. The I receive a reply, “We have received your comment. A team member will address your request as soon as possible.” I think that’s great, I should have an answer soon. I note that the embedded pics I sent were not in the reply I just received, so I put the pics in a small pdf and forward that to them also (just in case). I forget about this support case and 5 days go by with no answer from Samsung. So on 11/26 I forward them their last reply and ask, “I haven’t had a reply on this yet. On 11/20 I sent you the information &lt;pics&gt; you requested. Is there a problem?” A week goes by without a reply. So on 12/3 I forward the email case to a different Samsung SSD support email address that I’m aware of. I say, “Hi Samsung, I’m not getting any replies on my support inquiry to “support email address1” and that is frustrating. So today I’m trying this to your “support email address2” address, as follows: I haven’t had a reply on this yet. On 11/20 I sent you the information you requested. See “… 2019-11-20 14:13:18 “ and also the link to document1.pdf below. Is there a problem? Please advise . . .” Later that morning I receive their reply, “We have received your comment. A team member will address your request as soon as possible.” Finally I think, this will get answered. Later that afternoon, I receive their reply, “Your support ticket has been updated. As always, it is our pleasure to assist in any way possible!”. And here’s the real slap in the face: Below that “…pleasure to assist…” line there’s a comment box they filled out, it says, “Dear Customer, We apologize for the inconvenience, we have not yet replied as your request for SMART information has been escalated, Samsung does not typically provide information regarding Samsung internal standards when it comes to drive on board controller information. We have made a request for this information, however due to the holiday delays we have not received an update as of yet, as soon as an update is available we will contact you via this ticket. Your ticket number is xxxxxxxx.”. Today is 12/5. It’s been two days and it’s become obvious to me Samsung is not going to answer this question. Since Samsung decided to ignore what I consider a legitimate professional request, I’ve made that decision for them and decided to go public with this stonewalling. It’s my opinion that if the IT community cannot ascertain the health of an SSD using standard industry tools and industry standard attributes, then we shouldn’t buy their products. I’m very concerned that Samsung would choose to shroud the Attribute 177 in some kind of secrecy. It’s like they don’t want us to know the exact health of their storage devices. What are they hiding? I look forward to your comments, corrections, suggestions and directly related discussions. Regards,\nBret",
            "fzabkar----There is no official standard for SMART attributes. Each vendor is free to use their own format for SMART attributes, and in fact they do. Moreover, the SMART attribute definitions often vary between different models from the same vendor, and even between different firmware for the same model. So to answer your question, attribute #177 may be a wear levelling count for one SSD, but may mean something completely different for other SSDs.",
            "BretAB----Hi fzabkar, Thank you for your reply : ) Yes, I agree that manufacturer's frequently use their own yardsticks when displaying their SMART data. Imho that is unfortunate as I and other IT persons feel that standardized values are much better for the hardware involved community. Manufacturers should support the standardization so we can compare apples to apples. With regard to Samsung and the EVO SSD being discussed, I really don't care if they use icons of penguins to report #177 values. I just want to know what numerical value those penquins represent in terms percent of wear leveling. For example, do 13 penguins mean 13% worn? I don't think this is too much to ask of Samsung. Would you not agree? Please, other forum members (and even Samsung) feel free to jump in here! Regards . . .",
            "fzabkar----I agree that all vendors should provide detailed specifications for their SMART attributes. I would also like to see circuit diagrams, technical reference manuals, real diagnostic software, and data recovery software at the firmware level. I had access to this sort of stuff 30 years ago, but nowadays we get little more than marketing pap.",
            "BretAB----Better late than never they say: Unless I'm incorrect, I just found out that the Attribute “Wear Leveling Count” is now shown as a Statistic called \"Percentage Used Endurance Indicator\" and/or \"Percentage Used Endurance Indicator\". If interested see:\nInterpreting SSD Wearout Indicators for CloudGen Firewall Hardware Models. And . . . I do see \"Percentage Used Endurance Indicator\" on the 860 EVO 250GB (Model MZ-76E250). Hope that (is correct) and helps : ) Regards . . ."

            "PcolaTy_1----Hello everyone. I recently bought a Western Digital Black hard drive for my personal computer after my old 2TB Seagate SSHD started going out. Anyways, I've been having some issues with getting the hard drive set up and would like to help. Below are two scenarios that I've tried. 1. Boot computer to windows than plug in the new hard drive. The issue arrises when for what ever reason that Windows decides that it will become unresponsive. 2. Boot computer with my primary SSD and new HDD plugged in and powered. The issue is that for reasons that escape me, the BIOS does not recognize that there are any hard drives, but when I disable the HDD, it picks up the SSD and vice versa. Here are my specs for those who are wondering:\nCPU: Intel Core I5-6600k\nMOBO: ASUS Z170-A\nGPU: EVGA Geoforce 770\nRAM: 8 Gigs of DDR4 2200\nSSD: Intel 530 Series 180Gig SATA 3\nHDD: 2TB Black Performance Desktop Hard Disk Drive. Thank you for any and all help. ",

So from what I understand from scenario 2, your BIOS recognizes the HDD if the SSD is disconnected/disabled, right? It could be an issue with the BIOS, so I'd recommend that you try updating or resetting it, to see if the same thing happens. I'd also recommend that you try the drive with a different computer, to see if it's properly recognized and if you'd be able to initialize it: How to initialize or write a signature to a secondary hard drive or Solid State drive in Windows. Once you've initialized the drive, download DLG (Data Lifeguard) and run both tests (Quick and Extended), to see what's the situation with the HDD and if it's in good condition: How to test a drive for problems using Data Lifeguard Diagnostics for Windows. Hope that helps. Please let me know how everything goes.\nBoogieman_WD",
            "PcolaTy_1---- Thank you for your reply Boogieman and onto your questions. Yes, the BIOS does indeed recognize both the HDD and SSD when they are plugged in, but not at the same time. From what you've said, it seems logical that the first place to start would be a BIOS update and if I can get into my SSD, I can download DLG and test both of them out. An interesting note that I discoverered is that the HDD is in fact initialized adn up and running as I was able to get Windows 10 downloaded onto it without an issue and even managed to boot right up on it, until the BIOS lost track of the HDD that is. So, I will update the BIOS and report back to you. Edit: Just out of curiosity, if it is indeed just needing a BIOS update, than would there be anyway to wipe my 2TB HDD clean, or should I just boot up the HDD and uninstall everything than plug the SSD back in? Update: The BIOS update seems to have done the trick for keeping the system stable for several hours; however, it just recently started loosing track of the SSD again when I am in desktop.",

            "frishi----Hi Tom's Hardware, I just registered on this website. I am in the process of sourcing components to build a DAS and under an impossibly low budget of $300-$350. A little context:\nI already have a nice little HPDL360 as my home server, and it has 2 x 2TB SAS drives in RAID 0 already setup. Currently it holds and serves all my media. I have filled it to its maximum capacity. I could add another 2TB SAS drive; but I hope to accomplish my DIY project in the same price that I would pay for the SAS drive. Also: Looks do not matter to me, the whole rig can live on styrofoam or whatever substrate I can get my hands on. In the end, hopefully, I would have some room to add drives to my DIY rig without spending a crazy amount. --------------------------------\nSo far, I scoured ebay for all of the following: 1. Legit DAS enclosures such as the ones from HP; they were never in the price range. 2. NAS enclosures, which were either too limited in upgrade options (always 2-bay, 4 bay) or never in my price range or both. I know that for the power and options I am asking the budget is too limited. But I am a tinkerer and I want to build something, however ghetto, just to prove to myself that I can do it. -------------------------------- That said, here is what I am thinking: + I am building a DIY RAID rig with a motherboard, PSU and a RAID controller. + Hook up 4 x 1TB HDD to the RAID controller in the DIY rig. + Install a P800 card in the DL360 + connect the RAID controller of my rig to the DL360 via mini SAS cable. --------------------------------\nThe biggest question I have is whether I need a RAID controller in the rig at all.\nCan I just get an adapter like this one: LSI SAS3801E 3Gb/s miniSAS Eight-Port Host Bus Adapter http://bit.ly/H3atGb And install this in the rig, connect my HDDs to the adapter; connect the adapter to the P800 via miniSAS ? Just curious if you think this would work. -------------------------------- My shopping list so far: 1. JetWay JM26GT4-LF Micro ATX AM2 Motherboard with 2.1GHz Athlon X2 and 2GB DDR2 http://www.ebay.com/itm/171140099397?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649 (ALREADY PURCHASED) 2. 4 x 1TB Western Digital HDD (GOT THIS FOR FREE) 3.

Anyway, I think I can get away without using the P800. My modified plan is to purchase a RAID controller card and connect my HDDs to it. Then connect my ghetto rig to the DL360 with an ethernet cable. The mobo has a gigabit ethernet card and I think if I serving files from the server + rig combo, my data transfer speeds are limited by the read/write speeds of the HDDs. (correct?)

If the copy fails or takes a really long time, either your DVD burn was marginal, or your DVD drive is marginal or failing. The DVD player is able to scrape enough data off of it so that the error correction gives the correct video stream, but the computer cannot. If you suspect it's the former, you can try burning it again, maybe try different DVD-R blanks. If the problem is the latter, you'll need to replace the computer's DVD drive. You can use Nero DiscSpeed to test the quality of a DVD burn (though you really need to test the same DVD on multiple DVD drives). You may wish to find Nero DiscSpeed version 4.x.x.x.

For some reason you have a need to coordinate the backup data on each of those ten USB external disks with a specific internally-connected HDD that contains the original data. 3. I would assume from this that the original music files are categorized according to the type of music contained on those files, e.g., jazz, folk, classical, etc. So that you desire to maintain both your original files + backups in that categorized fashion. Or perhaps the music files are categorized by era or some other fashion. 4. Although you have stated the number of disks (10) comprising the total backup of the music files you have not indicated the total volume of data involved. Is it reasonable for me to assume the total data is not more than 6 TB? Perhaps considerably less? 5. Assuming that's the case, would it not be practical to utilize a single USB external enclosure containing a 6 TB HDD, multi-partition the external disk so that it contains ten partitions (perhaps of different disk-space capacity) and accomplish the backup process by cloning the contents of each of the ten internal drives to a specified partition on that USBEHD? 6. I do note your present ten USB external devices contain 2.5\" HDDs, however I'm assuming for backup purposes the 3.5\" HDD (6 TB disk, for example) would be more practical."

My SSD is 128GB, and my HDD had over 500GB of data that I couldn't move. So I removed my HDD and did a fresh install of Windows 10 on the SSD. I erroneously believed that I could just treat my HDD as a sort of folder with all necessary files in it. I thought I would be able to just create shortcuts to whatever programs I wanted to use from my HDD to my SSD. After all, everything is installed just fine on the HDD, so I thought it was just matter of reading that data. But I was sorely mistaken. Everything is a mess. Some programs like Steam work well enough, even logging me in automatically. I can start a game from Steam just fine (the game itself is installed on my HDD), but it seems like Steam automatically installed the proper drivers and such for me. Others, like my Corsair keyboard program, don't work at all. Firefox no longer has any saved passwords or bookmarks even if I go into the HDD (now my E Drive) and start it from there. Other games not connected to Steam don't seem to work even if I try running it from my HDD. A lot of programs are unusable at this point. Is there any solution? I feel like wiping my SSD and potentially starting over, but I think there's just a flaw in what I wanted to do. I just wanted the speed of the SSD and startup of the OS, but use all programs and files from my old HDD. Is that an impossibility? Is there something I can do that would closely achieve this? I realize what I did and wanted could be stupid, but thanks for reading and for all the help. For further clarification, both drives have Windows 10 now. Both are essentially two different computers at this point.",

The Windows \"registry\", as a byproduct, forces people who lose track or access to their application media have to buy it all over again. If this matters to you then use tools like \"Portable Apps\" which aren't tied to the Windows registry. You could also sign up for Office 365",
            "JohnnyLucky----The recommended solution is to do a fresh clean install. When an individual does a fresh clean install to a new ssd it also means installing drivers, utilities, software applications, games, and anything else to be stored on an ssd. Installing to an ssd is a lot faster than installing to a hard disk drive. When I build pc's for customers I can usually install Windows 7 Pro SP1 64 bit OEM in about 15 minutes. For my own personal pc I check web sites for updated versions of my drivers, utilities, and software. I download them and save them to a USB 3.0 flash drive. Again, installation is relatively quick. The only downside are all those Windows updates. Currently there are well over 100 updates and the downloads are slow. There is another reason for doing a fresh clean installation. Microsoft Windows does not do a very good job of deleting files that are no longer necessary. In addition Windows does not do a good job of eliminating registry entries that are no longer valid. Years ago we used to call Windows a bloated pig because of the useless files and registry entries that accumulate. There is no point in cloning or migrating those files to a brand new ssd. The second problem is with cloning applications. In general they work reasonably well and most users do not experience any problems. However, sometimes glitches and errors occur during the process. We have entirely too many threads in this forum about cloning problems. All you have to do is take a look at the unusally high number of threads about cloning problems. Red Alert! Shields Up! - You mentioned that Firefox no longer has any saved passwords. That is a security issue. Do not let an application \"remember\" your user id and password. There is no point in making it easier for an unauthorized individual to access your accounts, especially if your system is configured for wireless operation. If you have trouble remembering userid's and passwords, then write them down on paper and keep it in a safe place."

            "sirjuicylemon----Hello community.\nI am running on a PC build with a kind of old and cheap HDD from probably almost 10 years ago because I have a SSD that doesn't work (someone of my family formatted my PC many, many times on my SSD trying to solve some motherboard problems, and so probably corrupted my SSD or something). Anyways, the thing is that with this new build, with a new motherboard but an old HDD, I have been experiencing random freezes, which used to be like 1 in an entire day, but now are kind of 3 or more in a day. Sometimes it freezes really bad so it doesn't responds and I have to manually reset my PC, sometimes (rarely) it freezes by a short amount of time and then unfreezes and keeps normally, with a sound of a USB peripherical disconnecting/unplugging. As far as I know my PC shouldn't have any kind of problems with the build itself more than maybe the old HDD which may causing all of this freezing, but the sound Windows makes after unfreezing keeps me thinking that it may be a bad USB port on the motherboard or something... (I don't really know, it's just a suggestion). In any case here's my build:\nCPU: AMD FX-6300 Six core GPU: AMD Radeon HD7770\nMotherboard: MSI 970 gaming\nPSU: Spektra 500W\nHDD: WesternDigital (blue brand one) 500GB HDD\nRAM: 2 x HyperX Fury 4GB (DDR3 and 1866MHz) Please grant me your suggestions, ideas or solutions.\nMany thanks!\n",

            "sirjuicylemon---- Yeah, I was thinking about the PSU too.\nI'm going to check the temp of both CPU and GPU, but just to do ti properly, what do you mean with \"under load\"? (sorry, I'm bad at english) Is it like while doing stuff that requires a lot of effort for the PC? (like playing a game, opening a lot of programs at the same time, using a 3d render program like benchmarks, and stuf... ?) Also I ran a chkdsk before and I think it didn't detect anything out of normal. Also used today a program called EaseUS partition Master and checked my HDD with it, and again nothing out of normal. (Although after I did the chkdsk some of my programs like Steam and others had to re-register my PC as a certified device for my account's use and stuff, so I had to re-confirm the email verification and all that). I was also wondering if defragmenting my HDD would be useful in this case. I have no idea tbh, just a suggestion again.",
            "Dunlop0078----Yes, when the CPU and GPU are doing something, say running a game or benchmark. You can use a program like HWmonitor to check the temps, just open it and leave it open while you play a game or run a benchmark and either post a screenshot of it or tell me what the max temps are after playing, there will be columns for real time temp, average temp since the program was opened, and maximum temp. Idle temps, when the computer is doing nothing, would be helpful as well. Disk check will tax the hard drive heavily so if your computer did not freeze and no errors showed up that is a good indicator that the hard drive is not causing the freezes. A defrag is good to do every once and while for hard drive performance, but it is very unlikely it would solve a freezing issue.",

If the Maximus Impact's 4 SATA ports is a limitation, consider that the Asus Z87I-Deluxe has 6, and is fairly similar in specs but lacks the sound card and a few other fancy features. Long answer - There are 3 different mini SSD form factors, mini PCIe, mSATA and M.2. The first two are often interchangeable, as they use the same interface, but you can't take this totally for granted. The AsRock Z87E-ITX offers an interchangeable slot, but the Asus does not.\nThe Maximus Impact has two slots on a daughterboard (this link, scroll to \"mPCIe Combo II\nwith 802.11ac/Bluetooth 4.0\") one is for mini PCIe and is pre-occupied by the Wifi/Bluetooth, and the M.2 slot is free.\nYou are right that the orientation isn't clear, but given that one end will sit flush with the I/O backplate, it's a pretty safe assumption that it points into the case, with it sitting parallel to your graphics card.

The cursor was stuck in the \" I \" for text for a while and finally when the keystrokes went in I was patient enough to wait until it finally logs in.

So i've come to a conclusion that it is in fact my Hard drive that is causing this problem. I've searched through the forums and I've tried many solutions, the boot priority wasn't the problem.

Is there somebody at Tomshardware who has experience with cheaper NAS? NAS: It is a network storage. So you hock it up to your router or switch, and Synology f.e. automaticly gives you a DNS. This way, you can access your storage and the full OS over the internet over the web adress of your choice. You can also access it over your local intranet (Internet at home) of course.

            "jimbo328----Hi all, I have two problems: When it was operational, I had Windows 7 installed on my SSD, 2 2TB Hard Disks set for Raid1, 2 4TB Hard Disks set for Raid1. I defaulted on my bios settings that had the Sata drives in RAID1 and all the disks became independent of each other. I went into Bios and turned Raid Mode back on, in hopes that I can recreate the disks using Intel's RST. First problem - My 2 2TB Disks are able to sync back up as 1 disk (because no changes were written when it was in ACHI mode) , but most of the files are not showing. I would think that they are still there because the amount of used space is the same as before. I read somewhere that Windows Diagnostic test has a tendency to mess up system files, rending most of the files to disappear. How can I save this data? Second Problem - While I was in ACHI mode, I made changes to one of the 4TB hard disk, and now it doesn't sync back up as one after turning RAID mode back on. How can I rebuild the array to the newer-written disk? I greatly appreciate any insights, and thanks in advance. ",
            "13thmonkey----I'm not sure I can help, and sorry that this is after the fact, but to anyone else... raid is not a backup. Given the drives that you have, you could have had 1x2TB backing up to the other 2TB and 1x4TB backing up to the other 4TB. That would have given you the same capacity, speed and better recovery opportunities, the only thing it wouldn't have given you is dynamic recovery from a drive failure (you'd have to actively do something). Back to your problem:\nI've been able to use file recovery programs (in the C2D days), to recover a broken raid1 array, but I can't recall what it was. I found that my raid1's were more stable than my 0's in matrix raid.",

            "popatim----best answer I got for you is to get a backup drive big enough to hold all your data then backup the data you do see and then recover all the missing data you can (to the backup drive). Once backed up then you can try rebuilding the mft but checkdisk will only copy in the backup mft which sometimes is not a complete copy. If that doesnt fix it then its likely beyond easy repair and it would probably be way easier to just delete and recreate the arrays and copy in your backed up data. I use testdisk to check/restore the mft. Its in the advanced ntsf &amp; mft section: http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk",

            "rtothedizzy----I've got a very unique and annoying problem. I had a RAID 5 array of 4 1TB disks. I have a bunch of very important info on there (like 3-6 months of work). I backed up the parts I can't bear to lose but I can't back up the over 2TB of data that I would just really really not like to lose. Anyway, I wanted to expand the array and add another disk. I'm using intel matrix RAID so I just put another disk in, modified the existing array to expand it, and let the expansion begin. This was looking to take about 2 days or something crazy so I didn't pay close attention to it. In the first half hour of the expansion the computer crashed. I booted back up and found that two of the disks in the array (not the newly installed disk) were marked as failed and thus the whole array was marked as failed. This seemed super unlikely to me that they physically crashed. I marked the two disks as safe and it asked if i wanted to reinitialize the array. I said OK. This took about 8 hours. After it was done i could see all of my files but couldn't open any of them. I restarted and windows did an extensive disk check (took an hour or two) and said it fixed a bunch of orphan files. Now I can again open all my files but they are corrupted in a very unique way. Each file has a bit of it's data, then a bit of another files data, then a bit of crap, etc. Probably like you might expect from a RAID 5 array data storage pattern. It seems there has got to be a way to get my data back since it looks like it's all there just spread out between all the different files. I'm guessing that the data is still constructed in the manner it would be if I had only 4 disks as it didn't have nearly enough time to expand the array. Can I trick it somehow into going back to 4 disks? Any other suggestions?",
            "gtvr----If it was me, at this point, I'd be looking to call vendor support. These are really complex, low-level issues. Not to be a jerk, but if the data is that important, I'd go that route. Personally, I would have done that before marking the disks as safe and re-initializing. I believe you hosed yourself at that point. Lesson learned - back stuff up BEFORE messing with an array. A little paranoia goes a long way.",
            "sub mesa----You permanently destroyed your data by:\n- using FakeRAID5 without a full backup\n- expanding the array (very dangerous operation!)\n- probably you did not surface checked all the drives prior to expanding, and checked your RAM\n- after the expansion failed, you initiated yet another rebuild; this one destroyed your data. Now your data is there, but all kind of gaps and parts have corrupted data written to them.\n- launching disk check will write to the array; again this permanently destroys opportunity to recover otherwise recoverable data. So, in my eyes, you made some bad calls that leaded to the destruction of your data. That's the risk with RAID, and that's why RAID cannot replace a good backup. Using RAID5 is very unsafe; expanding a RAID5 is like gambling with your data; think of a 50% chance your data is gone and 50% chance everything works out ok. You can improve those chances by doing proper tests prior to expanding. Expanding a RAID5 is an extremely delicate operation where a minor error will cause a lot of headaches. Perhaps you should look for ZFS to prevent data loss in the future. Right now, i don't think there's any hope to get your files back uncorrupted.",

I backed up what I could but I don't have the controller or disk space to back up everything. I checked all disks before the expansion. My RAM has been checked before but you're right, I didn't check it right before the expansion. The disk check was inadvertent. I didn't get back to the computer in time to stop the automatic one. In the end it seems that I did a couple of stupid things to make a bad situation worse. You live and learn I suppose. Hopefully this doesn't happen to to many folks out there.

            "someonestrange----If I had to make a recommendation about the SSD you're considering - make sure you either get a pair of them in a RAID 0, or a higher capacity model. I have a 160GB SSD installed in my rig, and I've got about 150MB(yes, Megabytes) of free space left, while the rest is occupied by games. With new games taking anywhere from 4-40GB each on your computer, and Windows taking 15-20GB, and the fact that your drive's capacity is actually smaller than what's listed on the box, its not at all hard to fill these things up. Also, keep in mind that SSD's tend to scale and perform extremely well when placed in a RAID 0 together. If you have the free slots necessary in your computer, I would strongly suggest getting a pair as opposed to a single drive.",

Make sure one of the drives didn't come unplugged either from power or the sata connection. Try to use a different sata connection in case that the port failed. If you really need the data a company that specializes in data recovery can repair the hard drives, or at least get them into semi working condition, and extract the data. In the future try not to have a raid 0 on a drive that isn't backed up. A raid 10 or even a raid 5 is much safer than a raid 0. Also consider backup your data to an external hard drive or to a 3rd party backup solution. I currently use CrashPlan on my computer at home with about 3 terabytes backed up. I also use a raid 5 for my storage array.",

Having data from the rest of the member disks you can try to recover files. However, only the files which are smaller than (N-1)*(block size) can be recovered. Even files smaller than that limit can be unrecoverable if the part of the file happens to be on a failed disk. So in general, if one of the member disks fails beyond repair, it is impossible to recover data from RAID 0. I highly advise against raid 0 unless you keep very good backups. I normally run ether a raid 5 or 10, this helps so if you loose a disc you can get it replaced and still not loose everything."

            "masterxxxxxl----Since I switched from Windows 10 (x64) to Linux Mint 17.2 (x64), I experience Horrible write speeds on my Western Digital WD10JFCX-68N6GN0, with Partitions (first one ~537gb Formatted to NTFS, Second one ~463gb Formatted to EXT4). The Write/Read speed is at ~750kb/s with File Explorers, but the Speedtests with dd or gnome-disks say, that the drive is about 60-70mb/s fast. Is there a way to fix this?",
            "Boogieman_WD----Hey there, masterxxxxxl. Sorry to hear about the issues you're having with your drive. I'd suggest that you try the HDD with a different SATA port and cable, to see if the same thing happens. Make sure that you've connected the HDD properly. If nothing seems to change, you could try connecting it to a different computer, either externally (via a SATA to USB adapter, external enclosure or a docking station), or internally via a SATA connection, to see if the issue persists. If you connect it to a Windows computer, you could try testing the HDD for errors via DLG (Data Lifeguard Diagnostics): How to test a drive for problems using Data Lifeguard Diagnostics for Windows.\nI'd also recommend that you backup your most important data before you start those procedures, no matter how long it takes. Hope that helps. Please let me know how everything goes.\nBoogieman_WD",
            "masterxxxxxl---- I already tried another SATA Port and Cable, but this didnt change anything, and the Drive passed both DLG Tests without any errors. On the other PC, the write speed is in fact much faster. I also tried the SATA Cable, that I used in the other PC without problems or low Speeds, but on my main PC, the Drive is horribly slow again. I also tested another Port again. It seems like it's not an issue from the Harddrive itself, but I have no Idea where it comes from, especially, because the Speed tests I did with the Tools on my Main PC say all about 60mb/s, but writing actual files to it seem to be horribly slow somehow.

            "masterxxxxxl----Problem Solved: All the File Managers I used were the Problems. As I used the \"Nemo\" File Explorer, the files were moved at a normal speed. Thanks for taking you time anyway, the Advise with the DLG Tool Will most probably help me anyway in the future. ",

See Figure 2 here: http://www.supremelaw.org/systems/wd/western.digital.jumper.settings.pdf \"SATA Hard Drive Jumper Settings\" MRFS",
            "Paperdoc----It's not clear whether the new unit is IDE or SATA connection. If it's IDE and the ONLY device on the IDE channel, make sure the jumpers are set to Master. It also should be on the END connector of the 80-conductor ribbon cable. Oh yeah, also check that the ribbon cable is plugged in correctly. Usually you can't do this wrong - the connectors themselves have extra bumps and blanked-off pins to prevent doing it wrong. But just to check, the ribbon cable has one edge with a red stripe to identify Pin #1. On the mobo the port connector should have a marking next to it with the number \"1\", and the cable's red stripe edge must go there. At the hard drive, there also should be a \"1\" marking near the cable connector, and almost always this will be at the outside edge of the HDD case, not at the center. Of course, if your drive is SATA, none of this applies. Now we come to the more likely thing to do. I am assuming that you already have another HDD in the system that is your boot drive, and this new 640 GB WD unit is an additional drive that will just hold data and will NOT be your boot drive. You may have missed an important detail - ANY new drive needs a two-step process done to prepare it for use by Windows. You cannot just plug it in and get it working - if you do, Windows won't see it in My Computer, although it will show up in Disk Manager in the lower right-hand pane as a connected device not ready to use. The preparation steps are to create on the new drive at least one Partition (the first one on any drive must be the Primary Partition), which defines a space allocated to use as a drive. The second step is to Format this Partition, which establishes on it a File System with all its tracking components. After those two, Windows can use it. Windows has the tools for these operations in Disk Manager. If you choose to do these yourself this way, Go to Disk Manager and find the new drive in its lower right pane, probably showing its space as Unallocated. RIGHT-click on it and choose to Create a Partition. Make SURE you chose the new 640 GB drive, because what comes next will DESTROY ANY DATA on the drive you choose! This will be a Primary Partition. You can choose how much of the disk to use in this Partition, from all of the disk to any smaller portion. If you don't use all the space, the remaining space will be Unallocated, and you can come back here later and create another Partition in it. If you are not going to boot from this drive, do NOT set it to be a bootable Partition. Let it do its thing, then come back and RIGHT-click on it again. This time choose to Format it. You will have to choose a File System, and most users should pick NTFS for such large drives. Choose either Quick or Full Format. Quick does all the essential stuff like establishing the hidden file structures to track disk space use. Full does that, then runs a test on absolutely every sector of the drive, marking any faulty ones so they never get used. This may not be necessary because few new drives have such problems, and the Full Format will take MANY hours to run. But if you have the time, it's a precaution. When the Format is done, you reboot and find the drive in My Computer ready to use. There are lots of utility packages that will do both of these jobs for you, typically used as applications you just run under Windows. Just be VERY careful in choosing which drive to operate on - you do not want to wipe out any drives already in use!! You may have WD's free package already, called Data Lifeguard, if your drive came with a CD of utilities. If not, go to their website and download the right version for free. http://support.wdc.com/product/install.asp?groupid=0&amp;level1=0&amp;modelno=&amp;lang=en Make your way through the menus by choosing your drive until you get to selecting which version of Data Lifeguard. If you are just setting up a data-only additional drive (as I assumed) the one for use in Windows is good. A version that sets up its own DOS and runs from there also is available, and they recommend it if you plan to clone an existing boot drive to the new drive so that the new one becomes your boot drive. You download and run the file as specified, then use that software to make you drive setup process easy.",

Since then I keep an eye on Total Bytes Written (TBW), which escalated quickly showing me roughly 0,35-0,45 TB per day. For 3 weeks I've got 6,20 TBW, which is why I'm concerned because after the OS, drivers and programs installation I haven't written any data on the SSD.\nI'm worried this SSD is going to fail too soon and not reach the advertised 10 years guarantee.",
            "Mr5oh----I used to worry about my SSD, and then I realized they are about speed. The odds of me having that same drive in 10 years is zero. Heck even the odds of me having if it in 5 years is pretty low. I don't keep any sensitive data on them, other than that I treat it like a normal drive, when it dies it dies. By that time larger and faster drives will exist that I will want to upgrade too. I think you are being too paranoid. I wouldn't even look at that TBW counter, its just going to make you worry.",
            "C3ck0---- You're right. Should look at this counter less. Thanks for the quick response!",
            "fallven----I've got the same drive and I too think TBW is increasing too quickly, I haven't done much on this drive, but my TBW increased by 200 GB TBW in a week or so.",
            "C3ck0----I've observed data in Resource Monitor and i saw, that around 10 MB/s writes come from the PageFile. Unfortunately I don't have enough RAM to disable completely PageFile to test if it decreases the amout of writes per day or week."

Note that 0 + 1 (striping multiple drives in a 0, and then mirroring them) does not give as good a level of redundancy as 10, for multi drive failures. Also note that some RAID levels have more benefit for different workload types. Finally, popatim is correct in that RAID does not replace the need to back up your data. If you have an external array with support for 8 drives, you could configure 2TB of RAID 10 storage (if the controller/array supports raid 10), or less storage in RAID 10 and some for backup. External/removable backup is the best solution.",

I have an internal 1.5tb drive I use for backups and just started using mozy to backup off site. I’ve had two major crashing in 10 years one cost well let’s just say a lot of money because I was ignorant of backing ups. So I started backing up religiously, dual backups on external drives and DVD until my next crash 4-5 years later and learned the DVDs somewhere along the line didn’t burn right or whatever and when I went to use the usb drive its master file table got corrupted somehow. Of course only when I needed them… so about that time I learned a little about raid systems… tried a raid 0 the one that mirrors and the mft got corrupted and corrupted both the main and mirror because I was messing with something in windows… so since then I have had a raid 5 system with 2 backup drives and DVD general backups not image backups, and now in the last few months mozy. So I think after what you said I may reset the 4 drives to stripe for speed and backup weekly on my extra big drive and real time backup offsite to mozy… yah your right I’ve lost a computer to lighting luckily it didn’t have anything important on it.

            "seerongo63----Hi, I've been reading a lot of user reviews of various portable usb powered drives and I've noticed that there seem to be way more reliability issues with these usb drives than there are about internal drives in general. I wonder how many of these problems could be attributed to inadequacy of USB ports to supply enough current for the drives. At best I'll bet that most are marginally supplied and some are under supplied. For example, I just read that WD MyPassport Elite drives require at least 650ma (reportedly as per a WD company tech). USB ports typically only supply 500ma. Some drives even require the use of two ports, but most do not. Some come with very short USB cables, apparently to minimize resistance loss, maybe also to maximize data xfer speed. I've heard of a few people trying to use unpowered hubs also. What do you think about this theory?",
            "sminlal----Unpowered hubs can most certainly be an issue, particularly if other active devices are connected to them. Bus-powered drives only draw significant current when they're spinning up. Once they're at speed the current requirements are a lot lower. Now this may mean that underpowered ports may fail to initially recognize a bus-powered drive, but once it's recognized and become ready I don't see a particular reason why there would be any issues. I've have four bus-powered drives that I connect (one at a time) via a 10-foot USB extension cable with a full-to-mini adapter on the end and I've never had any problem with them.",

            "zakpack----I agree with the poster. If you look at the thousands of user reviews for most of the portable hard drives you will see hundreds of 1 star ratings for mostly issues with the drive \"stopped working\" and \"no longer recognized\". These comments are from numerous users who have only lightly used the drive. It appears their reliability is nowhere near that of an internal drive. When you read case after case of users who can't get the drive to be recognized any more, that sounds like a problem that is almost exclusive to external drives. Suspecting power as the problem sounds logical."

            "Madhuresh----Hello guys so it has been 1.5 year since i got the SSD, now the crystaldiskmark and Samsung magician both shows write speed of around ~320 MB/s which is unusual because i used to get 500 MB/s write speed initially when i got the SSD. Nothing in my system has changed apart from windows update. I even have AHCI enabled and have SSD connected in SATA 3 port 0. I also have cache writing enabled and have Samsung magician as well as the SSD firmware updated to the latest version. I even tried to connect the SSD in different SATA port but still the write speed is same (~320 MB/s). I have AHCI driver from Microsoft and around 42% of free storage on the SSD. I have TRIM enabled and RAPID disabled and have even tried to optimise drive using windows drive optimisation. I have tried everything but still cant get proper SSD write speeds as advertised. Can someone help me with this i read all the threads and posts across internet but nothing seems to work. My system specs are:\nRyzen 7 2700X\nMSI B450 PRO-M2\nMSI GTX 1060 OCV2\nGSKILL Ripjaws 8 GB x (2) DDR4 @ 3000 MHZ",

            "Raycorn----I had something similar happpen to my 860. The write speed dropped to 330. The culprit was userbenchmark which for some reason caused the write speed to go down. It may may been to do with Samsung's tubrowrite but once powered down the drive reverted back to its correct benchmarks speeds. I repeated the test several times, always with the same result"

I read that it needs 2 USB connectors. Any recommended enclosures or 2.5\" models? I'm looking at WD 10 JPVX 1TB, 8MB 5400rpm, SATA 3Gb/s. 9.5 mm",
            "Ironsounds----Hello... 1) USB will be your Slowest Communications/transfer option on this subject...\n2) SATA 3 5400 will be fine due to the slow transfer rates of USB.\n3) Yes, if just using a USB connector and NO wall wart (PS), you could run into some Power problems through the USB of your MB. Other options like Firewire, WIFI, network cable to cable modem, NAS unit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage",
            "SuperSoph_WD----Hey there, dfk! +1 for @Ironsounds and his thorough response! Thought the WD Blue WD10JPVX is definitely a good mobile storage solution, it's mostly used in laptops and notebooks for everyday purposes. However, its largest available capacity at the moment is 1 TB, which I personally don't think is enough for a backup external storage (but it does depend on the files you're planning to store there). We have the WD Green 2.5\" mobile HDD that is designed and recommended for use in custom-built enclosures and other applications that require cool and quiet operations (which is exactly what you are planning to do,right?). Its RPM is IntelliPower - which is a fine-tuned balance of spin speed, transfer rate and caching algorithms designed to deliver both significant power savings and solid performance. The available capacities for the 2.5\" form factor WD Green are 1.5 TB and 2 TB. I'd recommend you to take a look at its features and more detailed specifications here: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=VjR6PR I hope it helps. Keep me posted if you have any questions about it! SuperSoph_WD",
            "dfk---- Hi, and thanks for both of your replies. I didnt consider WD Green because its height is 15mm according to this site: http://www.wdc.com/en/products/internal/mobile/ and I wanted one to be compatible with most enclosures and possibly also my vostro 1400 caddy. 1TB is enough for me and I'm limited to USB3.0 for now. Also read some comparisons that WD Green might be slower compared to Blue because of spin up time when it's in low power mode though I may be wrong. Would a single USB3.0 be enough power for a WD Blue, if so I might just get it.",
            "SuperSoph_WD----True that! The WD Green would spin down thanks to the IntelliPower and it's a bit bigger in height. However, since you've already got the enclosure and the 1 TB capacity is enough, I guess it won't work for you. As I already mentioned, the WD Blue is just as good a mobile storage solution. As for the power it would require, any mobile 2.5\" HDD can be supplied with just enough through the USB hub without any additional AC adapters (in comparison to the 3.5\" bigger bros - the desktop HDDs). So yes, a single USB 3.0 enclosure should be more than enough for the WD Blue 2.5\" as well. Good luck! Hope I was helpful! SuperSoph_WD"

You mentioned you have an INTEL SSD - definately check it out to get maximum optimization out of your SSD. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-performance-tweak,2911-2.html Also I would like to add - TRIM is sent by the OS to tell whether or not a file is eraseable, if it is, it enables GC which activates on IDLE. So I may have incorrectly stated TRIM works on IDLE, its just that TRIM activates GC in IDLE."

My motherboard supports RAID, but doesn't seem to allow choosing two drives to mirror. Rather, it forces me to choose which ports I want to switch to RAID mode in large chunks. For example, I can set 1-4 to RAID not AHCI. Cool. That means I can't set 5-6 to anything other than RAID or IDE, which wont work. Those two ports have my boot SSD and another hard drive attached. If 1-4 is AHCI, 5-6 can't be RAID. This seems ridiculous. Who runs 4 drives in RAID and two drives in IDE? That won't even boot with modern systems. If I need a dedicated RAID card than so be it, but I don't want to go that route if I don't have to. Thanks, Rowan Update: I got into the raid settings, made a volume but now can't boot. Help. Help. What happened. Is it because my drives are now set to RAID not AHCI? It says my boot device is innacessible.",

Yeah, tell me about build times -- not too long ago I formatted a RAID 5 8 drive x 8TB He drive array, then I had to copy that array to another, but fortunately I used an SPF+ 10GbE connection so that only took another day. My worst experience was expanding a 7 disk to 8 disk RAID 6 array, took 6.5 days. :lol:",

I tried to make the volume, but after formatting it said it was a \"failed volume\". I tried to re-sync the volume but nothing happened, so I tried to format both drives again. One of them won't let me format and I don't know why. Tried DISKPART, it let me go as par as to create a new volume after cleaning the drive, but wouldn't let me format. Both these drives are new, but I'm running smart tests on both at the minute. Update: SMART test wouldn't run, so I quit SeaTools and shut down, then reset the CMOS. I don't know if that did anything or not, but when I booted back up both SMART tests ran and passed, and then my \"fast\" repair setting ran on both too. I have it set to do a full clean, but it seems like that might take all night, as both drives are only at 1%. Looks like you get what you pay for with big drives, big times for everything."

To copy over data from a dying hard drive, whether by using Windows systems or recovery software, a PC will have to be able to read the hard drive long enough to recover the data. Putting the hard drive into a USB enclosure is one way to do this without unecessarily operating your hard drive (the less it's used in this state, the better). Then either using Windows normally to get the files or something like Recuva. Beyond that, however, there's little you can do outside of paying a recovery firm to recover your data and a reputable one can, in fact, cost you more than $1000. It's an absolutely brutal lesson, either expensive or heartbreaking, but the basic truth of the situation is that if you had a hard drive for a year, you had a year to make this procedure cost $0. Backing up your important data regularly is a key part of basic computer upkeep, like changing the oil in your car or the filter on your furnace; an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. I sincerely hope that your lesson, in the end, does not prove to be so expensive."

Since the OS was pre-installed, you shouldn't face any issues with the clean install of Windows 8 and then upgrading to Windows 10 again. Regardless, if the hard drive, the OS communicates with the motherboard. You can easily upgrade to an SSD, however, you should check the warranty on your laptop first.

            "389poncho----Hello,\nHave a 2007 Dell E510 with three HDDs [W-10, W-7, XP Pro]. They all work very well. I needed one more SATA 7-pin port to eliminate having to move the Sata data connector back and forth. The card port was to be for the XP HD. The first card was a SY-SA3114-4R. The drivers loaded right away from the CD but when the HD was connected to that card, there was nobody home; could not find the XP HD [none of the 3 HDs could be found actually because they all loaded drivers automatically anyway]. You could sit and push F1 all day. I tried to make it work for two weeks. The next card was a SY-PEX40039. I was warned that this card could be too fast for my bus speed. This card was a PCI Express card so I tried it anyway but only spent a day on it. Of course it would not recognize the HDs either. This 3rd and current card was supposed to the hot ticket! It was said to boot any Dell people used it on. It is SD-SATA150R. Of course, I get the same result [a black pre-boot screen that can't get past F1 and still can't find a hard drive]. All 3 HDs are driver loaded and none can be found with any of these cards. Although I just need it to work with the XP drive.\nI've done all the common sense stuff like installing in safe mode, running as administrator only, switching many new SATA cables around, moving the cards to different slots, flash/updating the PC's BIOS at Dell's download center. I've installed from the supplied CD's, from a flash drive, from a saved file, from a DVD, from a floppy, from SIL's web site. That's all I can think of for now [I'm sure I forgot something though]. The PC's BIOS and Device Manager always see the cards just fine and always say the are \"working properly\". It can't be three bad cards, they just won't communicate with any HDs. Can anyone help me?\nMany thanks for ANY help,\nMike",

The computer's BIOS recognizes that their is a SATA/Raid card in the slot and the Dev. Mgr. shows the card and all it's info. Only when the HDs first auto-loaded the drivers, Windows showed that a new SATA/Raid controller was detected. EXCEPT Windows 10. It showed no pop-ups, nothing, then loaded the drivers \"secretly\" [;-).",

At the Silicon site, the PDF says this card can not boot an existing OS and must be installed during setup on a fresh install. HOWEVER, on the install sheet they send along with the card, there is a specific, EXACT instructions spelled out on how to install on an existing OS. Soooooo, being totally burned out by these 3 cards, I think I'll take a month [or a year {:-( ] off and do other things. T'care,\nMike \n"

            "jb0nez----I had a failing (SMART) few years old 2tb seagate. I replaced it with a WD Green 5200RPMs (WD20EZRX), cloned with clonezilla. Then later changed it for a refurb Seagate Barracuda 7200RPMs (ST32000641AS) (I believe it's a 4 platter, not the newer 2 platter) again moving data with Clonezilla . Both have 64mb of cache I believe. I use it for most programs and data storage. When I first installed the Seagate, crystaldiskmark and AS SSD both rated it for sequential read/write in upper 100s (attached to SATA III 6GB/s port). The other day I installed my WD Green as a tertiary data drive (seagate is secondary, ssd is primary). Ran crystal disk mark as AS SSD on both. Was shocked to see the Seagate is now around 95MB/s read/write sequential, whereas the WD Green is 150/140. On the other tests the WD Green was anywhere from 50% to 100% faster. What's going on? I had about 1TB of data on the barracuda when I installed it and did the first tests. Have since added about 200MB. It's FULLY defragged using mydefrag. The WD Green is blank atm. Would this have anything to do with it? I do'nt see how adding a moderate amount of data to the Seagate would drop its transfer rate so much. Is it worth it cloning the Seagate to the WD green and using it as my games/data drive, then wipe the Seagate, since the performance difference is so significant?\nWhy would it have slowed so much?\nThanks!",
            "H4X3R----because seagate sucks (&lt;-- best answer EU)",
            "Someone Somewhere----Generally the fastest area on a drive is the outside, which is written to first. It's possible that the Green is reading from there, while the test is a lot further inwards on the Seagate, because there's a lot of stuff around the outside. Also, random (4K) reads and writes tend to matter a lot more than sequential.",
            "jb0nez----Well the random reads on the WD green are even better than that Seagate..50% to 100%...but that doesn't explain why witj roughly the same amount of data the seagate has dropped so much. So..again..am I better off using the WD Green as my primary data drive?",
            "Someone Somewhere----Yes, it does explain it. More platter goes past the heads near the edge of the drive, compared to the center. Thus, more throughput. The seagate is already half filled, but the Green drive is benchmarking right at the edge. If you filled up the green drive, you'd probably get a worse result. I highly doubt it."

I have a WD My book Duo 12TB, the drives were set up and configured as individual drives using the WD Disk Utillities app, I mainly use the My book Duo for backup and storage, hence its rarely used. I recently purchaced a WD My book 10TB in order to expand the storage capicity for my WD duo, I removed the drive from its enclosure, I then removed one of the existing 6TB drives from the My Book duo and replaced that one with the new 10TB drive. The 10TB drive was configured and formated as a individual using the WD drive utilities. Now I had a WD My book duo with a 6TB drive with old backups and stuff and a new empty 10TB drive. I copied all the files from the current 6TB drive to the new 10TB drive. I then powered down the My Book Duo and replaced the existing 6 TB drive with the one I swapped out for the 10TB drive in order to copy the files from that 6TB drive to the new 10TB drive. The problem now is that the 6TB drive I removed in favour for the 10TB drive cant be found for some reason.\nThe drive is recognized by WD Disk Utilities as a new unit and not configured and Im asked to configure the drive and hence the content will be wiped...but I dont want that. I guess it has something to do with the configuration of the individual drive within the WD Utilities setup. Once I setup the new 10TB drive as a individual drive within WD Disk utillities I must have replaced / overwritten the old 6TB drive and hence it cant be recognized by the Mybook Duo anymore. The drive is found by Windows diskmanager but cant be initialized as GPT or MBR and is listed in the Diskmanager as Disk 1 - Unknown - not initialized. The drive is also found using diskpart but \"There are no partitions on this disk to show\" Is there some way around this? Can I somehow recover the files on the 6TB drive or are they lost?

Theres a option to initialize the disk but that operation fails. So to me it seems that the drive cant be accessed / initialized by Windows or any other program before I configure/ format the drive using WB Utilities and hence wipe all the data drom the drive. But following that logic I believe I will loose access to one of the other drives currently configured within the WD Mybook.",

When I first bought the computer part of the setup was to burn a backup system image disk. It took 4 DVDs, and I still have all of them. So I should be set, right? I have the install disk, and the new hard drive is installed. Unfortunately, about a year ago I had to replace the motherboard. The original motherboard was an m4, and that was what I made my backup disk of. My new motherboard is an M5, and evidently the 2 are not comparable. What is happening is when I boot up my computer I have the system image disk 1 in the DVD. I get a \"windows is loading files\" screen with a progress bar. Once the progress bar fills, I get the windows logo, but then the computer ejects the DVD and says \"This is not a m5blahblah DVD\" (the blahblah is just the mother board serial #). I called up Asus and they told me its because my disk was made with an m4 motherboard, not the m5 I currently have. He told me that I need a windows 7 install disk, and that using that to install the windows files would work. The only problem with that is that I can't find my windows 7 product key, and it will cost between $75-100 to re-buy it. Money is a bit tight, and I'm wondering if anyone here knows a way to use the install disk I currently have. Or failing that, is there some other operating system I could use. Or do I really have to use a fresh windows 7 install. Thanks for anyone that can help!!",

Unless you have some crucial data on it(in which case you will need to contact some data recovery companies), I would say that you need to get a new one. Cheers,\nD_Know_WD ",

It is a system for \"stringing together\" two or more completely separate (often different makers, etc.) HDD's into one apparent \"drive\". It is very common now for mobo makers who build RAID software into their BIOS's for their on-board HDD controllers to include JBOD in there, too, just because it is not hard for them to do. But the truth is that JBOD never was part of the RAID family. So you MIGHT have it already if your mobo has \"built-in\" RAID. Or, you might find a JBOD software package, free or not, by searching the web. RAID0 is not necessary for this job.",

You could then create short cuts to the shared big machine so that when you are working on any computer in the house you are always working over the network on the file that is stored on the raid. You will never have important info on your personal computer it will all always live on the big computer. The flaw to this is if you have a network issue while editing a word, excel or access file, you could risk corrupting the file. Or you can get all crazy and and have multiple copies of important stuff on the raid and on you personal pc. This is helpfull because you have 3 copies. If the big computer gets hit by lightning or is stolen or something crazy you still have the file on your personal computer. You can manage the syncing and keep all files up to date and the same using Microsoft SyncToy. It is a free tool from MS for windows. It lets you sync folders manually or automaticlly any way you want. My personal setup is an old p4 with a 2x 750gb in raid 1. I also have a 750gb in my regular computer. So all my important stuff like pics of the kid and videos, of wedding and stuff are saved on all 3 HDS. When I make a change I make it on my regular PC and then I maually launch SyncToy to make the 2 HDS on my P4 match my D: on my regualr PC.",

I Suggest nightly incremental backups for the file server (over RAID1) since it'll provide you with a history of the files to prevent accidental deletion or saving work you really didn't want. Imagine deleting a file on accident, it gets synced to the server before you can stop it, and it is wiped out everywhere. The way my server is setup I have a copy of the file up to 1 month old and it uses very little extra space. For synchronizing the files you could use something like - www.allwaysync.com I'm sure there are other solutions out there, but that is the one I'm aware of.",

This occurs automatically, and needs no intervention on my part (does need an active Internet connection). I use SyncToy to sync media files (music/movies) between PCs. This requires me to run the sync, though this can be automated. Both tools are free, and are from Microsoft. The drive mirroring you're referring to is RAID-1, where two hard disks are mirrored. This is a feature of your motherboard, and you enable it via BIOS."

If you had only several bad sectors it might have been different, because you could've tried performing a low level format (a.k.a. Write Zeros), hoping that the bad sectors will be mapped out and that the drive won't use them so that you can continue using your HDD for non-essential data. However having in mind how you've described the state of your drive, it doesn't really sound like this is an option anymore.\nI'd recommend that you get in touch with the vendor you got it from, or the manufacturer and try to RMA it due to the accumulated bad sectors, if the drive is still under warranty. In any case, if you decide to try the low level format, here's how to do it via Diskpart:\n1. Open CMD (Command Prompt) as administrator.\n2. type diskpart and press \"enter\"\n3. type list disk and press \"enter\", you'll see all the storage devices connected to your computer and you should be able to recognize the drive you wish to format by its size.\n4. type select disk X and press \"enter\", where X is the number of the drive you wish to format, so make sure that you've selected the correct one - e.g. if the drive you wish to format is disk 1, type \"select disk 1\"\n5. type clean all and press \"enter\", then wait for the process to finish. You should see a message along the lines of \"Diskpart succeeded in cleaning the disk\". Note that this could take from a couple up, to several hours depending on the drive's size, since it basically wipes and overwrites each individual sector of the HDD. After that you should initialize it via Disk Management, before you're able to partition and format it again, here's how to do that: How to initialize or write a signature to a secondary hard drive or Solid State drive in Windows edit: Sorry, looks like I've been beaten to the answer while I was typing. Hope that helps. Please let me know how everything goes.\nBoogieman_WD",

Even if the burner is defective (unproven so far), that would be unlikely to have any bearing on the flash drive/SD cards. Those problems are associated with the USB subsystem, either the USB controller isn't working or there is a problem with the drivers (corrupted and/or missing). I don't know if what I am going to suggest is available to you but if you can, back up all of your data (your DVD seems to write, you might be able to use it to create a backup - I'd make sure that the files are readable in another computer - IOW, I wouldn't trust that the DVD in your laptop is working correctly). After you've backed up all your data, I'd use the Toshiba recovery/reinstallation CD and I'd reinstall Windows clean. If the problems persist, then they are caused by a hardware malfunction.

            "seagate_surfer----The first thing you're gonna want to keep in mind is to stick with 7200 RPM, avoid 5400 for performance. Avoid 2.5\" form factor if at all possible as most of these on the market are 5400 RPM drives. 3.5\" Form factor is what you want. Regarding our offerings: You've got a couple of options here. If you're looking to stick to purely budget, a 1TB (ST1000DM010) or 2TB(ST2000DM006) BarraCuda is a good option. With your budget concerns, it's understandable why you're not wanting an SSD. They are awesome storage technology, but the cost for the amount of storage you're getting is quite high. If you'd like an option that gives you some of that performance benefit without skyrocketing the budget for the drive or vastly reducing the amount of storage space you're getting, another consideration would be an SSHD, or Solid-State Hybrid Drive (current Seagate branding: FireCuda). These drives place your most frequently accessed data on an SSD cache for faster load-time and performance, then also have a larger spinning storage capacity more typical of what you would see in a HDD so that you still get solid bang for your buck as far as storage space goes and has a 5 year warranty versus the common 2 years of the standard desktop HDD. Here are a couple of charts if you're curious how these drives fare in comparison to other drive types: The first one compares startup times across several popular games on a traditional spinning 7200 RPM HDD, our SSHD, and an M.2 SSD (128GB). The white is for SSD, the orange is for our SSHD, and the gray for the 7200 spinning HDD. Startup Times The next one compares the first 3 days of gaming storage utilization across several popular titles, and SYSmark ratings from various drive types and combinations. First of the grays is 7200 RPM 1TB spinning HDD, second (lightest gray) is our SSHD, third (darkest gray) is an SSD + 7200 RPM HDD combo, purple is SSD + our SSHD combo, and lastly blue is SSD. First 3 Days Gaming Storage Utilization Good luck with your new drive, regardless of which brand you decide is right for your needs in the end!"

I use it heavily- 4-5 hours per day. Internet, music, movies, downloading.. I used to play video games on it also (World of Warcraft almost a year). *Here is my problem. * The computer freezes randomly for about 3 minutes at a time before resuming. When it freezes, I cannot use my mouse. None of the laptop soft keys work. BUT, I can still hear music, except it is slowed down by about 99% (imagine a 5 second clip of music stretched out to 3 minutes. It sounds like buzzing, but you can still make out the notes). Also, while my cursor freezes in place, the \"working\" animation will sometimes continue to spin goes (the little blue circle). While my computer is frozen, I will hit cntrl+alt+del. Nothing happens, but as soon as the computer comes out of its frozen state, the task manager pops up. The computer usually freezes at least once per day, but I'll sometimes go a few days without a problem. This happens randomly, even when the only thing I'm doing is playing music on Spotify. BUT, when I'm downloading movies or music via torrent, my computer freezes up a lot more frequently (recently it froze up 3 times in an hour while downloading some big files). Sometimes it doesn't freeze at all though, even on long downloading sessions.. usually does though. Also, my computer takes forever to boot up. Sometimes I have to wait a couple of minutes before it begins to respond to opening apps. The computer also gets very very hot at times when I'm not doing much and I constantly hear the fan blowing, even when I use power saver mode (though, I'm usually plugged in and using \"High Performance\"). If it was a physical problem with my hard drive, wouldn't Windows crash completely? A friend suggested that there is something wrong with the hard drive cache. There are no entries in my event log. I've run a lot of different and reliable hard drive testing apps and none of them report a problem. I have run memory testing apps and none of them report a problem. I have run video stress test apps and there is no problem. I have run CPU stress testing apps and there's no problem. No matter what I do, I cannot reproduce this problem. I have formatted my drive and reinstalled Windows 7 multiple times. I really can't afford a new hard drive, but I will use the little money I have to buy one if this fixes my issue. But if it isn't the hard drive, I will have wasted $100. I seek advice here, because I'd like a more educated guess on what may be wrong. So, what do you think?",

However, when the computer eventually comes out (1-2 minutes) the task manager doesn't pop up. It also tends to freeze more often if i'm watching a movie or downloading a torrent, but then again sometimes not at all.

I think I have the gist down and wanted to just reaffirm that they are the right ideas: 1) I set the sata type to ACHI, use the usoft drivers (since I'm on an AMD platform), 2) after installing the appropriate drivers, run the WEI so Win7 can automatically set TRIM, prefetch/superfetch, etc automatically since it will detect the SSD, 3) don't benchmark it too much, 4) Garbage Collect works during idle times, 5) don't defrag nearly as much as I would with a HDD, 6) don't fill more than 80% of the capacity, 7) limit the page/swap file on the SSD or even move it to the HDD, 8) disable hibernation and System Restore to save space,\n9) disable indexing Now things that I have concern with are I've read numerous posts and articles stating that over using/writing kills the SSD. That makes sense to me, but my first question is that should I be trying to limit the amount of data I save to the HDD? Like for instance, installing/uninstalling programs, creating/saving new files and/or games, moving files around the SSD and/or to my HDD, things like that? Secondly, are there any other recommendations anyone has that I can implement before, during, and after installation? I really would like this drive to last me as long as possible, so any suggestions as to how to limit the writes or simply increase the longevity would be greatly appreciated.

My issue is that I decided to install 2 new hard drives, they are used, one is from my ps4 and the other is from an old pc I had laying around. My operating system is installed in a new ssd so that is all fine and well. I don't know how to format the two used ones, they are showing up on my device manager disc management disk 1 465.76GB, and Disk 2 298.09GB and it shows them having various partitions from the used devices I pulled them out from. When I right click it the only options it gives me is Convert to Dynamic disk, offline, properties and help. The other options are grayed out and cannot click on them.

            "Paperdoc----Let's just be sure we understand. You do NOT want to save anything on either of these HDD units. You want them completely wiped clean, right? Assuming the answer is yes, it looks like the path forward is hinted at in your post. Your last sentence says you can RIGHT-click on a Volume and Delete it so that it becomes Unallocated Space. Is that true of ALL of the volumes on both of those old drives? If yes, then that is what you do. Delete every one of those \"volumes\" on each of those drives, until each drive is only one block of Unallocated Space. Now you have drives with no data or structure, just like a new empty HDD. For each of those two old drives, RIGHT-click on its Unallocated Space and choose to Create a New Simple Volume that uses all of the space on that HDD unit. In one operation this will do a two-step process: first, create a Partition that will be recognized as a \"drive\" with its own letter name, and then Format that drive for you. Since you are re-using old drives, I encourage you to have it do a Full Format (not a Quick Format) of each drive. This process will take a while - at least half an hour, likely more, for each unit. When one unit is finished, do the same process for the other. When both are done, back out of Disk Management and reboot to ensure that Windows has all this correct in its Registry. You should now find those two units as empty drives with their own letter names, ready to use.",

Once the data is safe and sound copied elsewhere, you should reformat the hard drive from Disk management by deleting the whole volume and all its partitions. This will wipe all the data on it, but afterwards, you'd be able to transfer it back.

I'm afraid you won't be able to recover your files since you have overwritten the drive with the OS system files. If your files were that important, I'd advise you to contact a professional data recovery company, even though I'm not sure if they'd be able to help you out either. If you have those files stored somewhere else as well, you should reformat the external as explained in my previous post and copy them back to it.

I powered off, and restarted, and got bios message that no boot disk found. Going into the bios, it recognized the drive, it is listed there, but windows wouldn't run. I put the SSD in an identical laptop, as the primary drive, and it had same behavior in other laptop. I then installed it as the secondary drive of the working laptop. The bios recognized it as the secondary drive. In windows, device manager sees it (but in events tab, says \"device was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match\"). In the control panel - computer mgt - storage - disk management - also it is listed, but shows it is unallocated, and wants me to initialize it. i don't want to do that because i understand it is like a format and i will lose access to any data on it. As it is unallocated, it will not let me assign a drive letter to view it. i updated the firmware on the drive to the latest and that did nothing. i uninstalled driver and reinstalled, and that did nothing. i also created a windows 10 restore USB drive, and ran the troubleshooting on it, but it gave some generic comment about there are no fixes possible. if the laptop was an old version of windows, i'd just reinstall the OS, and there is a decent chance all would be good. But with Windows 10, they only have this recovery option, or if i choose to reinstall, it appears to format before installing (says files will be removed). I made backups of my files a couple years ago (time goes so fast), and i am certainly at fault for not regularly backing up. There is so much on the hard drive i'd like to get back, pictures, videos, everything you can think of.

            "The Green Fairy----So, I encountered this little problem soon after figuring out that 2 out of my 3 hard drives are basically filled with bad sectors. I knew about one of them, but the other was working flawlessly up to that point, where now half of it is magically broken. I tried upping an XP Pro SP3 installation on the remaining one hard drive, which is an old Maxtor IDE one, sporting about 42 GBs of space. Then this message appeared out of nowhere after the first reboot, and after I tried everything, it still does the same. To make this more comprehensive, I will list what I tried so far: -Setting the access mode to Large\n-Setting the access mode to LBS\n-Flashing the BIOS, which was unnecessary to begin with because I had the latest version already [ABIT NF8, version 1.9, correct me if I am wrong about this. Yeah, old PC is old]\n-Zero filling the hard drive from an Ubuntu Live CD [pretty much the only thing working on this PC] - not a thing changed afterwards\n-Changing the jumpers around\n-disconnecting and re-adding all the other hard drives, every combination\n-messing around with options in BIOS, I can't even remember what, but none of them even produced different error messages.\n-Installing Ubuntu on it. That time it gave me a simple \"Read Error\" line and then left it at that.\n-Installing Ubuntu on one of the other faulty drives, trying to start this one up from the boot menu [sorry, I'm new to linux, I'm talking about the screen where you can choose recovery mode and memtest], which threw me into a black screen with a command line and nothing else.\n-Trying Seatools for DOS to zero fill it - now this was funny. This piece of misery won't let me do any kind of erase on either this, or another Maxtor drive, the options are simply not there. I've read about this on the Seagate forums, and seen like a dozen people having this problem, and noone cared to answer them. I ran all kinds of tests on it though, and it says the driver is all fine and dandy\n-Setting the capacity to 32 GBs from Seatools DOS, since it was the only option available under the \"advanced\" tab. This caused the BIOS to not even try to boot up from the drive, asking me to insert a boot disk.\n-Trying Seatools from Ubuntu... oh wait, I can't since it's not supported.\n-Trying to install Win XP on the faulty drives to have it there as a temporary solution, or to use Seatools from there, but the installer flat out refuses to start an installation on any of those drives.\n-Offering sacrifices to the all the evil gods that might help me... you get the idea. So basically, the most I can do on this machine right now is run Ubuntu Live from a DVD I burned some years ago, and install it on a faulty drive where it will last for a good 1-2 days before going HURR and eventually reaching a stage where you can't even boot it. I just got a job, and I won't have the funds to buy a new hard drive, let alone another PC until mid-June, so it would be nice to have at least something for that one and a half month to watch movies/play games on, etc after I come home from work. Anyone has any other ideas to try? I'll be off trying to install XP on an 8 GB USB stick, but in the meantime, any kind of help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",
            "popatim----The only sacrifices us evil ghods take are virgins and I don't think theres any left in the world.

            "The Green Fairy---- Thanks for the link! It looks like an interesting little tool to use in the future. This time however, it didn't help, but at least I think I know more symptoms to the original problem. Here's what happened: Yesterday I managed to install XP on the other Maxtor drive that has bad sectors. Wouldn't let me format using NTFS, full or quick, saying that the drive is corrupted. Fair enough, although it had no problem doing that before... So what I did was, I deleted all partitions on it, and made a 10GB one for system purposes, which I formatted with FAT32 [quick], and voila, it worked. Granted, it's a faulty drive and won't live for too long, but at least it will work until I fix the other one. Then I tried the Hiren boot disk [USB in this case, I just about ran out of all disks I can burn]. First thing to go for was the Seagate DiscWizard, which loaded up to some point, then when it booted out of the DOS part of the program, it says something like \"To use this program, you need at least one Seagate or Maxtor drive on your computer\". For repetition's sake, I have 2. After that error message it froze and refused to do anything. So, since I tried running it from within XP, I knew it said something like \"this program runs only under Mini-XP, so I gave that a try. Mini XP booted all up, and in the startup console it said that it placed all the shortcuts to the desktop successfully, but in actuality the desktop was empty, and I could't do anything from there. Bummer. Then I tried that other eraser program, which gave me a blank blue screen, saying that it found a floppy drive and it tries to read a floppy disk. I don't know what kind of timelord technology this is, because I didn't have a floppy drive for the last 6 years. Anyway, it once again hanged there, but at least let me type some commands, which didn't do any good, so I abandoned ship once again. Then I tried booting up the DOS programs from the disc, and it froze right upon starting that menu up. Just my kind of luck. Then after all that, my XP installation keeps saying that it is unable to read the System folder, saying it's corrupted. It actually happened during installation too, if I had the 42GB drive connected. In other cases it simply says \"Error Loading Operating System\" [even if it's empty and the OS is installed totally elsewhere], but this time it corrupts my installment for good. Neat. So that being said, my options here are limited to anything outside programs that run under Windows or Ubuntu in an installed form [\"Read Error\" appeared in the same fashion there in the past], but I can do stuff from an Ubuntu Live disc or anything that boots itself from CD or USB. As a sidenote, I'm done with all nVidia hardware. Both my motherboard and graphics card managed to get otherwise \"popular\" errors to which no fix ever worked so far [motherboard doing this, graphics card having an unfixable nv4-disp.dll BSOD problem, stuff like that], which is really freaking impressive. I'm not giving another cent to this company from now on, that one's for sure.",

I've been trying to figure out if I'm using IDE or SATA II on my OS. I have doubts thats its not running SATA because I've heard you need to install the drivers from a floppy on the OS installation, so I assume since I did not do that then I'm running IDE In my BIOS the HDD shows up on SATA 1 Port and I have all SATA options \"enabled\" and IDE Disabled.

For a good reason, I may add; some CD and DVD drives did not work with AHCI mode. The good news is that you are running full-out SATA II transfer speeds. The way to see and set the disk mode is somewhere in the BIOS (I'm feeling to lazy to download the manual for your motherboard) where you can set the onboard SATA ports to IDE, AHCI, or RAID mode. AHCI mode enables some additional features: TRIM, which only matters for SSDs, Command Queueing (someone correct me if this works with IDE), and some others. The bad news is that, with XP, it is not trivial to take an install that was done with the ports set to IDE mode and run it with the ports set to AHCI mode. There are four choices:\n1) Live with it in IDE mode, as this does not slow the transfer rate to EIDE rates.\n2) Set the motherboard to AHCI mode and do a clean install.\n3) Get the AHCI drivers for your motherboard, open the correct entry in Device Manager, and change the drivers. Then shut down, change the mode, and reboot. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS WITHOUT BACKUPS. You have one try to get it right before the disk becomes unbootable. I did it once just for sh1ts and giggles.\n4) Get someone here who knows a better way than I do to help, or someone who can better explain the differences in modes. I was happy with IDE mode until I got an SSD. Have fun",

You say the transfer rate is unaffected right? -Thanks again",
            "Paperdoc----WyomingKnott is right, and you are right to stop worrying. You ARE getting all the SATA II speed. By using IDE Emulation Mode on your SATA ports (the easiest way to use SATA and Win XP) you are missing out on a VERY few features of AHCI. Among these ARE one or two items (like Command Queing) that MAY help with speed on certain types of file access, but will not make a large difference in the overall scheme of things.

All drives are SATA - I have 5 drives attached, including one external drive over e-SATA and additionally, two optical drives attached. My OS drive is in the fastest SATA port, which I presume to be the first or primary controller, closest to the board. My problem arises when one of my additional storage drives fails to show in Windows - typically, I'll re-install the various SATA controller drivers from the P67 Support page to correct this and reboot. When it does show back up, my C:\\ drive may fail to boot on the next restart - I think the actual message refers to BOOTMGR, but I can't recall. Why does this happen? The only way to fix it is to boot off a recovery CD and use DISKPART to set the disk as active and then run fixmbr commands or let Windows do it's repair thing automatically. I can also get this problem to happen if I change out which controller my primary OS HDD is attached to - I have to run the repair commands. I typically encrypt my OS drive with TrueCrypt or DiskCryptor and when I run into this issue, it causes all sorts of headaches - having to unencrypt my ENTIRE drive and then go through the motions of booting off the ODD for the repair commands (this usually wastes an entire day.) What can I do to prevent my additional drives from disappearing, is there something I can check in Windows Disk Management utility or somewhere else? What about the issue arising when SATA ports are changed? I have read the sticky FAQ on SATA controller issues, but I'm unsure how this relates to my problem, as I'm not really upgrading to a RAID array or switching drives for an OS install.",
            "photonboy----I don't understand everything your saying, however I'll try to help. 1) Failure to boot can happen if your Windows drive isn't set as the first drive in your BIOS' boot order. 2) I recommend using the BROWN SATA connector for your boot drive. Leave the second one free. Make sure it's set to AHCI in the BIOS (all your drives should be). 3) Do you have any boot issues when ONLY the Windows drive is physically attached? 4) I'm unfamiliar with those encryption programs. Are there any known issues with that software? 5) Have your \"disappearing\" secondary drives already been formatted and viewable in Windows Explorer? 6) Finally, if you can successfully boot with ONLY the boot drive attached to the Intel, BROWN 6gbps connector, add your secondary drives one at a time (unplug both the SATA and Power connectors to all other drives). I recommend using the INTEL controller for your hard drives for now. Boot on brown, and secondary on black. *You'll run out of connections without using the Marvell, but for troubleshooting just use the Intel. Start with only:\na) OS drive on brown\nb) DVD drive on black 7) BIOS updates (not sure what OS you have, or if you have any 3TB drives but update to the latest BIOS regardless and also read the comment under v1801 regarding drive capacity)\nhttp://www.asus.com/Motherboards/SABERTOOTH_P67/#support_Download_36 Here's your SATA layout:\nIntel® P67(B3) chipset :\n2 x SATA 6Gb/s port(s), brown\n4 x SATA 3Gb/s port(s), black\nSupport Raid 0, 1, 5, 10\nMarvell® PCIe SATA 6Gb/s controller : *1\n2 x SATA 6Gb/s port(s), gray\nJMicron® JMB362 controller :\n1 x Power eSATA 3Gb/s port(s), green\n1 x eSATA 3Gb/s port(s), red and note:\n*1: These SATA ports are for data hard drives only.

Only then should secondary drives be added. *Simply unhook all drives other than the Windows drive and attach it to the Brown SATA. Ensure the BIOS for that SATA connector is set to AHCI. If it boots up then the boot files are correctly on the drive and reinstallation of Windows should not be necessary (in this case it may be a simple Boot Order issue). If you can NOT get the Windows drive to boot on its own (try other SATA connections if you wish) then I'm back to simply recommending a reinstallation of Windows with ONLY that drive attached (aside from the DVD drive of course).

You might try a different format type under Windows, but if Windows itself only sees it as a 57 MB card, you may need additional software before performing the task, as I suspect Windows will only format the card to be as large as it currently sees the card to be. I would personally try booting into a utility such as GParted: http://gparted.org/ See if you can identify the memory card and remove any partitions / formatting from it, then see what Windows can do with it. Of course, use the utility at your own risk and don't delete things you don't recognize or are unsure about. You can cause irreparable damage if you make mistakes with a tool like GParted."

            "WyomingKnott----\nUmm, that's 4 gigs, but \"No.\" However: Back in the days when we carried data around on flexible pieces of plastic inside fiber sleeves, the size limit of the medium was about 1.44 Megabytes. Not Gigabytes, like your flash drive, but Megabytes. These fragile, primitive devices were called \"Floppy Disks,\" although if one was floppy it was probably too damaged to use. To transfer files larger than this limit, primitive man first developed compression software. To transfer files whose compressed size was larger than this limit, a great programmer named Ugh (I don't know why I'm doing this stupid olden-days cave-man riff; please excuse me) came up with the \"spanned file.\" The compressed file was broken into 1.44 MB chunks, which could then be re-assembled by the decompression software at the receiving side. So either reformat your USB key with the NTFS filesystem, or re-compress your mail file but find the settings in your compression software to break it into multiple files of less than 4 GB each. How to do this depends on which software and which version of it you are using. Edit: Now that I think about it, 1.44 MB floppies are fourth generation or so. I have some 360KB 5.25\" floppies around somewhere, although my drive requires a floppy controller, and those don't seem to exist anymore. The 8\" floppy was in use at about 180 KB in 1972, if I can believe what I read on Wikipedia. And the \"fiber sleeves\" were for the 5.25\" floppies; 3.5\" floppies have rigid cases. Old Grogg here is getting mixed up about his earlier days. Edit: I'm going to go take my nap. I originally wrote \"NFS filesystem\" instead of \"NTFS filesystem.\" NFS filesystems are for mounting disks on remote Unix hosts.",

If other drives are attached, windows will try to reserve a recovery partition on one of them. You might defer activation untill everything is set up, you have 30 days. It is easier if you have to redo something.\n4) After everything is set up, attach yout other hard drives.\n5) Do not try to micromanage ssd space, at least for a while. 64gb should be plenty, 128gb would be better.

            "DieHorn----Hi All, I've noticed in Samsung Magician the total terabytes written (TTW) by my 500GB Samsung 850 Evo SSD has been increasing. I initially noticed back at the end of July 2021 that my TTW for my SSD was around 145TB, when I was thinking about getting an M.2 drive. Since then this has been increasing by almost a TB a day and my initial online searches for the culprit point towards Shadowplay in Geforce Experience. I checked my settings and instant replay, recording &amp; highlights were off but the TTW kept increasing daily by around a TB...that's a large amount. My only logical idea is that this is the shadowplay temporary file constantly writing to my SSD as it saves and overwrites the last temporary recording, even though I have all the recording options off. I uninstalled Geforce Experience completely, but the TTW kept increasing to the point where it reached 158.1 TTW from 145 TTB in less than a week. I decided to disable 'nvidia container' completely and followed a guide like this: https://appuals.com/fix-nvidia-container-high-cpu-usage/\nThis worked, my daily TTW didnt increase on Samsung Magician at all. I thought I would try enabling 'nvidia container' again (as accessing Nvidia Control Panel and shadowplay is useful), so used DDU to remove Nvidia drivers and reinstall the latest driver and Geforce Experience. As soon as I did this, I've noticed my TTW start to rise again. As of today it has risen to 163.4TTB. My Samsung 850 Evo has an expected lifespan of 500 TTW so it is not the end of the world - but it is a process that is constantly running the background eating up system resources and my SSD. Would be grateful for any assistance, if there is a way to isolate what it is exactly in the Nvidia container process that is constantly writing to the SSD. Otherwise will just disable Nvidia container again. Posted on Nvidia forums and didnt get a reply, seems like a cemetery. Found this other post on Tom's here too: https://forums.tomshardware.com/thr...-writing-alot-to-ssd-in-a-short-span.3712260/\nMany thanks in advance for any help.

Anyways I have this weird issue with my PC that I believe to have diagnosed down to a faulty hard drive but still, have the issue after cloning the data to a new drive.\nMy current setup consists of an Asus B350 Gaming F-Type with a Ryzen 1700x Cooled with an H110i V2 with an Asus ROG GTX 1080 Strix and G.Skill TridentZ 8GB*2 3200Mhz Ram Finally with a Corsair CX850M PSU.\nI'm not sure if the specs are important as I believe this has to do with storage but I figured I should include them.\nThe Storage setup is as follows 256Gb Inland (Microcenter) M.2 NVMe SSD boot drive, Kingston HyperX 128GB SSD scratch disk, Seagate 2TB FireCuda for games etc and Seagate 2TB Barracuda for documents and additional programs.\nThe problem I triangled to the Barracuda by running the system after unplugging it (thankfully it went away with the first drive). The issue I have is under light CPU load (web browsing VOIP calls etc) the computer will randomly crash with a black screen. I checked dump files and event viewer anyways several times but returned no evidence every time. The weird thing about it is it requires the power to unplugged or switched off at the PSU level before it will receive input from case buttons (Power/Reset). After crashing even a minute plus hold of the power button doesn't do anything although the reset button does weirdly seem to kill the RGB drivers for Razer Chroma X keyboard as the LEDs will stay frozen the same color they were at the time of the crash until the reset button is pressed but no cursor movement, however very rarely the PC restarts on its own. This suddenly happened after coming back from a weekend at a friends house in November 2018. Couldn't have been electrical damage though because I always unplug ethernet and turn off the power strip switch when I'm away for a while. Any Help Would be so greatly appreciated because this issue is getting really aggravating and I'm stumped.\nThank You,\nSRHM PS: things I've tried/done in chasing this issue.\nLikely Affected:Replaced MOBO,CPU,Tested and swapped to known good ram,Swapped to known good GPU, replaced power supply (wanted more wattage anyways had a cx600) and swapped the 'problem drive' from a WD Blue to the barracuda, reinstalled SATA driver, chkdsk, sfc, defrag, sector scan, virus scan, registry repair (ccleaner) and new SATA cables.\nUnlikely affected: New keyboard, tried another mouse, leaving extra monitor and peripherals unplugged, bought new primary monitor, added Thermaltake TT aura sync fans controller and ROG RGB terminal, changed cases, used another houses mains power, Monitor arm mount XD.\nPSS: I didn't just start throwing money at it to try and fix it I followed the list of what I thought would be most likely bad and a lot of the stuff I had already planned on purchasing/upgrading.\nPSSS:I'm especially disappointed with my self because I am very technical, I am in my last quarter of high school in an info tech program before I go to college to get a bachelors in network administration or cybersecurity some2ndnoun .",

You can do this by opening my computer, right-clicking the 'c' drive, going to properties. When the new window opens, choose at the top 'tools', then 'check now'. The chkdsk window will open, click 'start', it will tell you that you must schedule chkdsk after the next restart, say yes and restart your computer. Once this is done, see if installing a game is any quicker. If not, and you want to 'be sure' the hard drive is OK, repeat the above steps but choose 'check for bad sectors', it will take a loooot longer to run, but will test your drive for physical defects. Once the hard drive is out of the way, we then need to do some clean boot troubleshooting, via MSConfig. http://www.tomshardware.com/faq/id-1898058/enable-disable-programs-windows-startup-helps-fight-viruses.html If clean booting does not alleviate the problem, we can try more stuff.",

When this happens does task manager show anything using a lot of CPU cycles, or is anything thrashing your hard drive to make it at %100? If safe mode doesn't help (mind you you have no hardware acceleration so it would be slower, but definiately a lot faster than 2hours) then windows does seem to have a problem. If this has stopped working recently, did you try system restore? If it is a configuration/software/driver issue, then that should fix it. Another thought, overheating will slow you down a lot as well, if you can obtain some motherboard monitor software to test temps, might be of help also.",

Do not hesitate to contact their support team and see if they can give you a free download/license for the software if you it can recover the data. Ask them to stand behind their brand and ask to speak with a supervisor to \"escalate\" the issue. This has worked for me in the past. You never know if you don't ask.

It would get me a much better spec NAS for less money, plus I enjoy building things from scratch. I am still a novice to networking and don't know my way around linux but looking to learn as I go along. Here is what I want it to do: 1. Stream high bitrate 1080p bluray rips to my popcorn hour A300 and ipad\n2. Central file storage and cloud\n3. Run an intuitive GUI\n4. Eliminate the need for equal sized HDDs (something like Synology Hybrid Raid)\n5. HDDs to spin down when not in use My current setup:\n1. Panasonic plasma (dumb)\n2. Popcorn Hour A300\n3. PS3\n4.

Xpenology seems very interesting but I'm concerned about how stable it is, especially when it comes to updating. Freenas is also attractive but AFAIK I would need all HDDs to be the same size.\nAlthough my popcorn should be able to play my rips, I want to be able to transcode for the ipad, PS3, PC.

            "Captain_WD----Hey there, I would say building your own NAS has its ups and downs but in case you decide to make it on your own, here are some advice I could give you.\nThe CPU might be a bit overkill for home usage. Processor is not of that big importance if the NAS is not used for enterprise or business purposes so I would downgrade that a bit. The MOBO looks good and solid. It supports up to 6 SATA 3 drives and RAID 0, 1, 5 and 10.\nI would add another 4GB of the same type (2x4GB) for the Dual Channel. I would say 8GB of RAM would be much better for this build and for what you are looking for.\nWD Red drives are perfect for NAS as they are designed specifically for that and should work great with the rest of the components. Have in mind though that they do not spin down when they are not used. WD Green series do spin down but are not designed and are not recommended for NAS systems.\nDepending on what you are looking for, you could go with a fancy transparent case or something compact to hide somewhere in your home. I would recommend getting a case with a good airflow (air going in from the bottom and exiting from the top) and enough space for all components plus option to expand it in the future. I would get a good-rated PSU with good Voltage Stability and Ripple and a proper fan orientation. A PSU is something that you could use in future builds and, in my opinion, something you could spend good money on. Hope this comes in handy, feel free to ask if you have any questions, Captain_WD.",

They are mostly high bit-rate 1080p in BDMV format with DTS-HD MA. is it possible to stream that on a gigabit network with this hardware? Popcorn hour is capable of playing it so that eliminates the need for transcoding as far as I know, correct? which means I would only need to transcode to the PS3, PC and ipad. I was looking at the Lian Li PC-Q25B Mini-ITX, which is well reviewed but is restricting in terms of space for PSU. Only leaves me with 140mm length according to the literature, plus it's expensive. The cheaper option is BitFenix Prodigy Mini-ITX, but again this limits the PSU because of space restriction. I want to be able to use a modular PSU but can't seem to find a case with enough HDD bays to accmodate it! Lastly I would like to end up with 5-6 HDDs but cannot afford to buy them all now so was hoping to add as I go along. Synology Hybrid Raid allows that, but is there another OS with a similar feature? Thanks very much for your help. I've been spending too much researching this. Sometimes I wish I would just buy something and spend the time actually making use of it!",

I recently upgraded my computer to a 250GB Samsung SSD for the OS and 3 3TB Seagate 6Gbs hard drive in raid 5 with a 120ssd cache drive (64GB cache/48GB Data) using Intel SRT via onboard controller on the MSI Z87 G45 Gaming motherboard. Posting take only 2-3 sec longer to detect the raid array but when it get to the \"Starting Windows\" screen with the waving logo, it stays there for a good 20-30 sec. Before with just the SSD, my boot time from the \"Starting Windows\" screen was about 2 seconds. I am currently initializing the raid 5 array. Could that be the reason why it is so slow? It's only about 83% done after a week as I don't leave my computer on 24/7. If you have any suggestion about what is causing this please let me know. I will try to post some hard drive speed test as soon as possible. Thank you all ahead of time for taking time to read and help me out with my problem.",

            "ATB88----Hi there! I have an old Western Digital WD10JMVW-11AJGS0 mypassport drive from 2013, and it has recently stopped being recognized by my new macbook pro, and does the rhythmic beeping/clicking. After doing some research it sounds like this is usually caused by heads being stuck on the platters. I have attempted to repair the drive myself (I know, this is generally a bad idea, but the data here isn’t that valuable and I’ve actually taught clean room microelectronics lab classes, so I have a higher aptitude for this than the average person – still not a great idea vs a professional that specializes in this repair, but anyway). Upon opening the case, I was expecting to find the heads stuck to the platters, as that seems to be the usual cause of the beeping issue. Instead I found that the heads actually were not on the platters at all, and that the platters appeared to be completely damage free. If the heads aren’t stuck to the platter, what’s does anyone know the next most likely cause of the beeping issue? Interesting data point: I put the cover back onto the drive and tightened only a couple of screws. Plugged the drive in and miraculously, it spun right up, no clicks and no beeps! However, it was not at all recognized in Disk Utility in MacOS, so, something’s still up. Now, the interesting part is: if I keep it running and put two more screws in (that secure the case to the head assembly) the beeping returns! Undo the screws, the beeping goes away. Does this give better insight into what the issue is and whether or not there’s a possibility I can repair this myself? Also, what drives have interchangable parts for my drive? I see on ebay that there are many variants of the WD10JMVW. My particular variant, 11AJGS0, seems to be much rarer and much more expensive than the others, at least on ebay. If I were to purchase a drive for donor parts, does it need to be a 11AJGS0 variant? Or will any variant of the WD10JMVW do? I’m looking into having the drive recovered by a professional, and a place local to me, [some site] , has quoted me $500 before any replacement parts. $100 of this charge is a flat fee that they add for “encrypted” drives, which they insist that this model of drive is. Is this drive really encrypted? If this drive just had software encryption, then I’d like to argue that the $100 encryption fee shouldn’t apply here, as I definitely was not using the the encryption software and had completely wiped the drive of any such software before putting my data on it. I just haven't been able to find any definitive information out there about this model. Do I have a case? Finally, if I got the professional route, can I do better than a $500 flat fee (before replacement parts) for a professional (I’d be willing to pay an amateur for half the price, again, this data isn’t essential to recover) to recover this drive? Thanks for any insights ",
            "rgd1101---- why then?",

            "ATB88----\nBecause while it's not that valuable it would be nice to have. If after my attempts fail, there's still potential for recovery down the road, I may consider it. Mainly I'm mostly interested in whether or not I can pull this off myself, but the stakes for failure aren't very high. I understand that what I'm doing is inherently very risky and even if I succeed I wouldn't condone this to other people. I realize that you get what you pay for with professional clean room services, but if I can get away with paying significantly less than $500 to recover the data, even if it means much lower chance of success, I'm willing to give it a shot. Also, of course, it goes without saying that I take any suggestion made here with an outlook that I'll probably fail, and if that happens it's my fault for mucking around with the drive to begin with. That said, would love to learn more about what could be going on with my drive here Right. Is there any way to figure out for sure if this specific model of drive had internal encryption?

The file recovery can't read encrypted files they way it should, and it will see just a mess of data without any real order or construction. It's like this, you create a robot that can take torn paper and arrange the parts to form the original sheets. It knows to to look at the paper parts, and put it together to form a sheet of paper by knowing how the parts go together. That's the recovery program. Now you take a piece of paper, and you not only do you rip it up, you also take those parts and then cut up the edges so they don't fit the way they did originally. The robot can only fit the parts that fit together, but since you manually changed them, the end result of the paper is garbled, not the original text that was on the paper, but you have words and letters in all different places. That is what a recovery program will do with encrypted files. What you needed to do was decrypt the card, then run the restore on it. Encryption is great for privacy, but once you need to work with data recovery or a failing device, then it gets very very hard to work with."

I just bought a new WD Ultra 1TB and read the instructions and it says keep away from vibration when in use. Will this ruin my drive if I continue or just shorten life?

The other reason was... by keeping it on the case it was connected to the front ports so it was easier to plug in and out."

If you can afford it you should always get a bigger Cache.\nHowever the cache is not noticeable past the point where the data is being passed to the Ram.\nSo the question for you is what applications will you be primarily running? If you're gaming then there's very little improvement from a cache size because the data is only loaded once and not constantly written to and from the hard drive. Where as programs that constantly save and read data from the hard drive would benefit greatly from a larger cache. I'm not saying games don't constantly load data to and from the hard drive but they do it at large amounts at big intervals when the data is needed or changed. So your decision should be thought about the primary use of your computer or application of the hard drive.",

I was simply referring to cache size in my OP for hard drives. I wasnt sure if Id really notice much of a difference between 16mb or 32mb.

For example, Seagate HDD models that Read/Write at 125MB/s have 16MB of cache.\nThe models that Read/Write at 210MB/s have 64MB of cache.\nhttp://www.seagate.com/internal-hard-drives/desktop-hard-drives/desktop-hdd/ Western Digital HDD models that Read/Write at 126MB/s have 16MB &amp; 32MB of cache.\nThe models that Read/Write at 150MB/s have 64MB of cache.\nhttp://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/2879-771436.pdf If the 16MB cache HDD and the 32MB cache HDD that you are choosing between both have the same Read/Write speeds then save some money and buy the 16MB cache model."

The difference in space comes between the difference between a gigabyte as interpreted by the marketing departments, and a gigabyte as interpreted by your computer. By convention, and to make their products look more attractive, drives are sold with capacities listed using decimal SI prefixes where a gigabyte (GB) is a billion bytes. However, your computer is a binary system, and defines data sizes differently. A kilobyte, to your computer, is 2^10 bytes, or 1024 bytes. Similarly, a megabyte is a kilo-kilobyte, or 2^20, and a gigabyte is 2^30, terabyte 2^40, and so on and so forth. This results in a compounding error that gets larger as you move through the list of prefixes. By the time you hit terabytes, you're down to about 90% of the space you were expecting."

I have looked on some parts websites and I am mostly confused about the controller part ; Why exactly should I care about whether it is a Intel or SandForce or anything? Is the controller built in the drive itself? -Will the controller impact on motherboard compatibility issues?\nIs it as simple to install as a standard HDD (plug and play)? I do have a recent machine with Asus Sabertooth X58. This thing has a Marvell Sata3 controller that gave me some problems / performance issues. I am wondering whichever this crazy Marvell controller thing has anything to do with an eventual SSD \"controller\". I'm not sure if this is clear enough.. Feel free to redirect me to any relevant thread that I have missed, as I have dug quite a bit into forums without finding precise enough answers. Thanks a lot",
            "inzone----A SSD is actually 2 or more drives in a raid setup and that is where the controller comes in , all SSD's have a controller that makes the seperate drives into one. If you have ever heard anything about a raid setup you know that one of the reasons they setup a raid is for speed. That is why SSD's are so much faster than conventional hdd's.Sandforce makes really good controllers and a lot of companies use them , while Intel makes thier own for thier ssd's. The controller is built into the drive and for the most part there are no compatability issues , but you can come across one but it is rare. SSD's are plug and play just like conventional drives. Of all the controller chips the one you here about most with problems is the Marvell. Unfortunatly I think all the motherboard manufacturers use Marvell , but I do think that there is a trend to try and get away from thier chips.",

            "ram1009----I disagree with most of what Inzone said. All storage devices have controllers. HDDs &amp; SSDs both have them. The controller is the electronic equivalent of a driver in software. Simply put, it \"controls\" the electronic interface between the HDD or SSD and the rest of the system. SSDs are faster than HDDs mainly because electronics are faster than mechanics.....much faster. Sanforce and Marvell are two major manufacturers of controller chips. If you read the reviews for both you MUST conclude that the Sanforce controllers, while faster than Marvell, are much more trouble prone. Both companies are trying to control their problems with firmware upgrades but the results are mixed. There's an article on Toms comparing the failure rates of HDDs &amp; SSds. The conclusion is that they are about the same, however what they are actually comparing is the failure rates of the controllers which should be the same. Only time will provide the proof of what is intuitively true. That being that SSDs are much more reliable over time because of the complete absence of fragile moving parts."

The drive failure turned out to be a blessing because over the years I have begun to use my PC for audio recording and video editing, and now I have the opportunity to have an ideal setup -- namely, a working drive and a storage drive. I have purchased:\nWD Caviar SE 160GB 7200 RPM 8MB Cache SATA2 (working)\nWD Caviar Black 500GB 7200 RPM 32MB Cache SATA2 (storage)\n2 SATA2 cables I will have the OS (Windows XP) and all other software installed on the working drive, and all of my audio and video files stored on the storage drive. So, no software will be running from the second drive. So, I am replacing one, 160gb Maxtor drive that was setup on IDE with 2 SATA2 drives. This is where my question comes into play: after I install the drives, is it necessary to set up the drives in a certain RAID configuration? Specifically, for two SATA drives? Each drive will have its own direct connection to the mobo, unlike 2 IDE drives on one cable (master and slave). This further complicates my situation. I looked at the sticky RAID FAQ, but since I'm not really familiar with RAID at all (4 years with 1 IDE drive), I'm not sure where to begin and need to understand this before I install my new disks. Either an explanation on here or a referral to a site with a clear tutorial/explanation of SATA2 RAID setup would be great! ",
            "1stclassrepairdotcom----Here are the specs for my mobo, if needed: ASUS P4SD-LA PES revision 0.01\nIntel ICH5 supports two UltraDMA/150 SATA connectors (I know the 3.0gb/s SATA2 should automatically downgrade to 1.5)",
            "kaimaikid----Not really an expert at all but am doing a 3 drive set up in my box 1 x 500gig as the working disk and 2 x 1tb disks in raid1 configuration for storage raid1 basically has 1 disk redundant which its sole purpose is to mirror the other disk so if one should fail, you still have all of your data on the other. I also use Acronis true image home to back up the working disk to cover my butt should anything go wrong with the working disk which is NON raid. if your system supports doing that, then could be something worth thinking about.",
            "cjl----You don't need to use RAID, no. In fact, in your situation, I would probably recommend against it. RAID is used when you want multiple physical drives to show up as a single logical drive to the OS.",
            "Paperdoc----No, you do not need RAID. As CJL said, RAID is actually a bad idea for you. The confusion starts because so many mobo makers now include RAID controller capabilities in their on-board SATA controllers, but they normally are off by default and need to be turned on to the RAID setting if you want them. First, one important difference from IDE is this: IDE was created to run two devices on one port and cable, so each device needed an identified (as Master or Slave) on the shared port. SATA only allows one device per port, so there is no such thing as Master / Slave in SATA. And Master etc. has NOTHING to do with which device you boot from. Some SATA drives (Seagate does this, I'm not sure about WD) have a little jumper on the drive. This is solely for forcing the drive to run more slowly for compatibility with the first version of SATA if that's what your mobo does. If you have SATAII, set the drive that way. Seagate's system was: drive arrives with jumper installed by default for slower original SATA, and SATAII users just remove and discard the jumper. Check what WD does with your drives. When you install your drives, technically it does not matter which SATA port you connect to. However, many put the one you expect to use for the OS on Port 0, and the other on Port 1, etc. Go into the BIOS Setup and look for three things. 1. You may need to Enable the SATA port(s), especially if you were not using them before. 2. For each port you may have some options for its operating mode. Possible choices are: Native SATA, AHCI, IDE (or PATA) Emulation, RAID. Don't choose RAID. IDE (or PATA) Emulation is a good choice. Windows does not know how to handle SATA drives all by itself, but it does know everything about IDE devices. The Emulation mode has the mobo take control of the SATA drive and make it appear to the world outside (read, Windows) as if it were a simple IDE drive. Windows is happy and blissfully unaware of the situation, and everything works. Alternatively you can have the mobo use either Native SATA or AHCI modes, but each will require a driver loaded into Windows. Well, I understand that VISTA has SATA drivers built in and this may not be an issue for that case. AHCI has a few advantages, but likely they don't matter for you, so you have little need to go that way. 3. Eventually you will need to specify a new Boot Priority Sequence in the BIOS. However, that may come AFTER you move all your stuff onto the new drives and remove the original IDE drive. When you get there, I suggest a priority like: CD ROM drive first, then SATA 160 GB drive, and no other options. (My own case has a floppy drive ahead of these two because I have one of those.) Hmmm! I see you say your old drive failed. Maybe that means you are doing a complete fresh XP install to new drives and not cloning from the old drive. In that case, be aware of some wrinkles in this process. It is not related to SATA - this is a drive size issue only linked to \"48-bit LBA Support\". The original LBA system from the '90's allowed addressing of hard drives up to 137,000,000,000 bytes or, in M$'s terms, 128 GB. A newer version with longer addressing called \"48-bit LBA\" moves the limit into the petabyte region which is so big I'll never see it! To use that system you need both hardware and OS software to support it. ALL SATA hardware does this. Windows XP did NOT support it in its original version - it was added with Service Pack 1 and later. So, if your Windows XP Install disk is the original version with no Service Packs included, you will not be able to use you new large hard drives as single large disks. Well, at least not for the boot disk with the OS on it. However, if your Install disk has SP1, 2 or 3 included, this is NOT an issue for you, so skip the rest! IF you only have original-release XP on your Install disk, you have about three alternatives:\nA. Buy a newer Windows XP OS which includes one of the Service Packs and use it. Costs you money but is simple.\nB. Learn how to Slipstream your existing original version. This costs you nothing but takes time and understanding. It is a perfectly legal process to take your fully licensed Win XP and upgrade it to a new Install Disk (you end up making it on your own CD burner) that includes all the latest upgrades to XP. Microsoft's website will outline how and provide you with downloadable files and instructions for upgrading your software. There are also good step-by-step instructions and tools for the process on several websites.\nC. Use what you have and live with the limit - also free, and relatively simple to do. In this scenario, here's the sequence. You Install XP to your new OS HDD - the 160 GB one. But in the first stages it will Partition and Format your disk at only 128 GB and install to it. That will leave some Unallocated Space on your hard drive that can be set up later as another Partition of about 20 GB and used as a completely separate \"drive\" with its own letter name. Right away after installation, you should go to the M$ website and download and install all the updates, starting with Service Pack 3. When you're done, your XP will be fully able to use large hard drives. But your C: drive will still be 128 GB and you can't change that easily. Now, with this new large drive capability you can install your 500 GB data-only drive and use tools to prepare it for use as one large drive. By \"tools\", I mean either the WD Data Lifeguard software free-to-download on their site, or the tools built into Windows Disk Manager. Basically in a 2-step process (the WD tools make it even simpler) you create a Partition of specified size on a hard drive (in your case these will NOT be bootable partitions - you already have one called your C: drive), and then you Format it with an NTFS File System. You can do this for your 500 GB drive, and separately also do it on the Unallocated Space left over on your 160 GB drive."

            "thundagawd----When I first got my PC into working order, I didn't have the HDD for the first week or so (I had the OS installed on an SSD), and ever since I've received &amp; installed the HDD (Seagate Barracuda 3TB) I've been hearing weird noises occasionally/with increasing frequency. Kind of like a very high pitched buzz/hiss of metal on metal (It's hard to describe). At first I though it was a wire somewhere that would occasionally get sucked into a fan and get bounced back into place, but my cable management was flawless (I went the extra mile and got individually braided cables to clean everything up behind the motherboard tray), I also came to realize that I only started to hear these weird noises after installing the HDD and installing a bunch of programs on it (Mainly Steam &amp; Origin along with voice chat services and overclocking tools, it's primarily a gaming computer), and lastly, I was playing TERA a few hours ago and the game would lock up/freeze when I heard these weird buzzing/hissing noises, which was odd as I've been running every game flawlessly since I've begun to play on this PC (Literally everything I've played so far has had zero issues. I get an average 75FPS in Crysis 3 on max settings W/4x MSAA, to give you an idea). I have no idea what the signs of a defective HDD are, so I'm hoping someone can give me some insight/confirmation regarding my assumptions, as I'd rather get this potential issue fixed ASAP (I don't have a whole lot of stuff on the HDD, and all the important bits are on the SSD, but unfortunately I have a monthly download limit and I'd rather avoid redownloading all my Steam games if something bad were happen). Also somewhat related to the topic, I've heard that Seagate storage devices are prone to failure more than many other brands. If I have to get the HDD replaced what brand would be a good recommendation? I've heard a lot of good things about Western Digital, but if I could get some more opinions that would be awesome.",
            "Bassim Ansari----I haven't had problems with Seagate ever. That argument holds false, as people with preferable brands generally start dissing as the moment something of a particular brand fails. E.g When AMD drivers come out, and they are not that well optimized for games, start blaming AMD and saying they always suck. When in reality, Nvidia has driver issues of its own too sometimes. About your other problem, you can run HDtune Pro and perform a good test of your hard drive to look for bad sectors. That's what I can recommend for checking your hard drive for any problems.",

I'm not biased towards any HDD brands as I don't know them very well, I just go with what seems like the best deal I'll check my Drive tomorrow with the tool you mentioned, gotta head to bed soon (Working a 9 hour shift at a toy store on Christmas Eve), thanks for the advice!

That's essentially what the random IOPS is measuring. 27 MB/s random 4k read and 51 MB/s random 4k write is about average for a SSD. And 85,000 and 100,000 IOPS (which correspond to the 4k 32 queue depth) is actually really good. For comparison, most hard drives are around 0.8-1.5 MB/s random 4k read/writes, and 100-150 IOPS (yes, that is not a typo - a hundred to a hundred fifty). This is actually where SSDs get most of their speed. Their sequential read/writes are only about 3-4 times faster than a HDD. But their random 4k read/writes are typically about 30-50 times faster, and IOPS/4k with queue several hundred times faster. If you've ever had a virus scan kick in on a hard drive and the computer almost becomes unusable, this is why.",
            "cloneuser----Thanks for replying, But I still don't understand, the sequential shown by software is ~ 500 MB/s but real copy is only 100 - 200 MB/s ?",
            "Solandri----\nSequential reads are just like the name implies. A large, single file which needs to be read all at once. Random 4k reads are a bunch of small (4k) files which are read. (Random 4k Queue Depth 32 means the drive is instructed to read 32 files at once.) These are the two extremes when it comes to reading/writing data to a storage device (most sector or addressable memory cell sizes are 4k). The sequential scores are just a raw measure of how quickly the drive can read from its memory cells or off the platter. The random scores include latency caused by having to go through the file system to (for an SSD) look up individual memory addresses for each file or (for a HDD) reposition the heads and wait for the appropriate part of the disk to spin under the head. Consequently the random 4k reads are a lot slower than sequential reads. When you copy a bunch of your personal files, the speed will fall in between these two extremes. Exactly where in between depends on the size of the files you're copying. If you're copying a bunch of 1 GB movies, then it'll be closer to the sequential speed. If you're copying a bunch of 10k text files and Word documents, then it'll be closer to the 4k random speed. I assume you copied from one folder on the SSD to another folder on the same SSD? That'll roughly halve your speed since the drive has to spend half its time reading, half its time writing. The 137-158 MB/s you got is about what you'd expect in that case. It's slightly better than the 350 MB/s read + 161 MB/s write from the 4k QD32 score. (The actual number would be half the harmonic mean, or (2/(1/350 MB/s + 1/161 MB/s))/2 = 110 MB/s as as the expected slowest self-copy speed.)",
            "mad-max79----Everything is fine. Your Evo has a so called Turbo Write Cache, which has 3 GB capacity, after this is filled up everything gets written directly on the SSD with 130-140 MB/s like you measured."

So they created specialized hardware to do those calculations, put them on a card with hard drive connectors, and you had a RAID card. Nowadays, the average CPU can do the parity calculations without even blinking. In fact every RAID chipset I've seen on a motherboard is actually fakeRAID. When it boots to the OS it loads a driver which does the actual RAID. In other words, it's exactly the same as software RAID except there's a bootstrap in the BIOS which allows you to hit F9 or something while booting to put you into a menu to set up your RAID arrays (OK they do allow you to RAID a boot drive easier than a purely software solution). Dedicated RAID cards are used almost exclusively by corporations which don't want to mess around with software/driver incompatibilities. When they buy a RAID card, they usually buy a few spares and keep them in the closet. That way if the RAID card ever dies, they can just swap in a replacement and be back in business. If you buy just a single RAID card and it dies, (1) your data will be inaccessible until you can buy a replacement RAID card, and (2) your data is gone if they no longer sell a compatible RAID card. So really, software RAID or fakeRAID is a much safer solution. I should also point out that outside of benchmarks, there's little benefit to using RAID 0 unless you do a lot of sequential (large file) read/writes. For small files, it can even perform slower than no RAID.\nhttp://www.hardwarecanucks.com/forum/hardware-canucks-reviews/49858-seagate-barracuda-3tb-raid-0-performance-unleashed.html\nhttp://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-raid-benchmark,3485.html",

One of my friends told me the speed of a hard drive is important and that a slow hard drive will basically slow down your entire computer. Is this true? If so, what is a recommended are drive speed and what storage size do you recommend (I am going to use it for gaming) also what hardware is needed to connect your hard drive to your mobo and what are reliable brands you've had experience with. Much Thanks\n-Computer n00b",

            "seogoat----Any of the seagate or western digital caviar black drives are fine. Some of the fastest drives are raptors but they wear out quicker and are too expensive.",
            "sminlal----Yes, hard drive speeds are important. With modern processors as fast as they are, every time you're waiting for your PC to do something chances are it's the hard drive that's holding things up. It's important to understand that there are two different ways to measure drive speed: access time (how long it takes to find a file), and transfer rate (how long it takes to read or write the file once it's been found). For most people who want the computer to boot and start programs up quickly the access time is the most important factor. This is because there are a lot of files that have to be found, but they're not terribly large. There are basically three classes of disks: \"Green\" drives which use low power, typically spin at 5400rpm, and have relatively slower access times and transfer rates (most laptop drives fit in this category too). Standard drives spin at 7200rpm and have medium speeds. And high-performance drives spin at 10,000rpm or more and have the fastest access times (although these drives typically don't have transfer rates any better than the other drives). SSDs (Solid State Disks) are the ultimate in performance - they have access times that are about 100X faster than a standard hard drive. But they are expensive and have limited capacity. The best combination is usually to buy as high-performance a drive as you can afford, even if it's relatively small, and use it to install the operating system on. Then you can buy a larger, slower drive to hold all your data files. Generally speaking, it's a lot less critical to have good performance for your data (but there are exceptions - video editing is one that comes to mind). Somewhere in the range of 60 to 120GB or more is probably a good size for the OS disk, depending on how much stuff you expect to install on it. For the data disk, the sweet spot in terms of cost/byte seems to be around the 1TB size. All modern desktop drives and motherboards use a SATA connection, it's pretty foolproof. But if your motherboard is older than a 2-3 years it's possible you need IDE (also called \"PATA\") drives. Modern drives and motherboards use SATA Version 2.0 which has transfer rates of about 300MByte/sec. This is faster than needed for any hard drive and it's even fast enough for pretty much all of the SSDs on the market right now. SATA Version 3.0 is just starting to be rolled out in the newest products, and it might be required to get the best performance out of SSDs which will be introduced in the coming years.",
            "Paperdoc----^ +1 for sminlal Just a note of caution. Many gamers in the past have sworn that you get the ultimate performance by using a RIAD0 array system of 2 disks, preferably using the very fastest Raptor disks or something like that. I am NOT a gamer, so don't consider my advice the best in your field. BUT if you want to consider the RAID0 route, look up the info carefully. RAID0 has risks involved, more that a \"normal\" disk system, that make it extra important to have a good regular and frequent backup system in case you lose ALL your data. Plus, I have the impression that most modern HDD units are so fast that the advantages of RAID0 are small (but still not none), so you have to weigh advantage versus cost versus reliability."

            "knvntvm----Request assistance. Toshiba Canvio 1.0 TB external hard drive. I had created 4 partitions.\nI have opted a blank partitioned area (E) to create Recovery image (create Recovery DVD) for my Lenovo ThinkCenter Edge Desktop. The program warned me that everything on the disk will be lost; I thought everything on E will be lost and proceeded. On completion, I realized that everything has been erased (including all partitions) and the Windows Explorer said that the External HDD contained only 32GB, of which some part has been used for the recovery image! I then decided to discard the recovery image to make the HDD blank and recover all the storage space. Deleting the data did not help, and therefor I have reformatted (did the full reformat, not the quick reformat) the HDD. However, even now Windows Explorer is showing only 32 GB in the external hard disk.\nHow do I recover the whole 1 TB and what program should I use to achieve this?",
            "D_Know_WD----Hi there knvntvm, Just go to Disk Management -&gt; delete the partition(right click on it) -&gt; create new ones.\nApart from that, you can start with using some partition recovery software and see whether you will get something back. Though, you have done some reformatting as well as created some partition. It is highly possible that the data is overwritten. Hope this will help,\nD_Know_WD",
            "knvntvm----Thank you. I opened the Disk Management utility (by pressing ⊞ Win+R and typed diskmgmt.msc) and noticed that though the disk 1 contained 1TB (usable appx 950 GB), only 32GB was partitioned and allocated to E. As instructed I deleted E and then created 4 separate partitions. All well now. Yes, my existing data was lost (but fortunately, I have all that on the system HDD and can now back up again). Thank you for the timely tip. Best regards\nknvntvm",

If you have received all the help you need, please select the appropriate options to remove your question from the 'Seeking Assistance' list. Thanks! You can make a recovery CD that you can boot to using a lite version of Linux for in case windows fails you. In the case of malware which could be designed to infiltrate even the windows recovery partition, you will want to have a recovery CD on hand. Using a different OS for the recovery is a good strategy to avoid activating any windows malware during your recovery attempts. Also, you can hardly boot windows from a CD! (Except Windows CE, 95, 3.1 etc.)\nFrom the looks of it, you already solved your problem and are no longer seeking assistance. However, it also appears that windows had over-written the partitions when it created your recovery info. Why this happened, I don't know. Will this happen again? I don't know. What I do know is that you can run windows as a virtual machine and in doing so, it could be restricted to writing to a virtual drive and then it can only destroy virtual partitions within a single file rather than taking down a whole drive as it did.\nLook into Xen and 'bare metal hypervisors' to learn how to run windows as a virtual machine, thus locking it into a sandbox where the harm it can cause will be limited."

            "papagym----A few months back I build a new Intel DZ68BC System. I installed Windows 7 Ultimate on it. Then I find out that in order to use XP Pro on the new system it had to be installed before Win-7. Now I need to do a clean install of Win-7 so I figured this is a good time to setup XP Pro on one of my new drives. XP Pro is on an IDE drive on my old computer. The new PC is currently configured with Win-7 on 128GB SSD, a HHD WD Green 1-TB w/ a backuo and system reserved partitions and a HHD Seagate 1-TB which is empty. I bought a bidirectional IDE to SATA Converter just in caae I need it. I want to make a system mage of the IDE (XP Pro) to a SATA drive. The IDE has CAD programs on it so I don't want to loose them. What is the best way to make the system image? Should I put it on the SSD first or onto an HDD? What progam should I use? Is there anything else I need to consider? Thanks",
            "Hawkeye22----I would think that a 128gig SSD would fill up fast if you dual boot two OS's off of it. You may need to put whichever OS you use the most on a SSD and the other on a hard drive.",
            "WyomingKnott----If I understand correctly, the OP isn't proposing to put XP on the SSD, but dual-boot to Win7 on an SSD and XP on the HDD. papagym, I have a suggestion for something to try first. You can download XP mode for Win7, basically a virtual XP machine that runs within 7, and run your CAD programs under that. If they work, that is probably a more supported solution. In regard to what you propose to do, you only have to install Win7 first if you are going to do a fresh XP install. And even then there is a way around it, if you are going to install on a separate drive. You can, in theory, clone the XP to a new HDD with almost any clone tool. Problem is that it won't boot, as it has the wrong drivers for the HDD and the motherboard. There are solutions for that. One is to use a clone utility, actually backup and restore, that has the option to restore to dissimilar hardware. EASEUS ToDo Backup is free and claims to do this, Acronis True Image is not free and is very popular. The other is to do a straight clone, detach your Win7 drive, boot from the XP CD, and do a Repair Installation. Then you put the Win7 drive back. In either of those cases, booting from the SSD will give you Win7, and booting from the HDD will give you XP. You will have to choose the boot in BIOS at first, but you could use something like EasyBCD to add the XP as an option on the Win7 boot menu. -------------------------------- Do you still have installation disks for XP and for the CAD programs? Reinstalling them might be simpler. Who knows, the CAD apps might even run under 7.\n",
            "papagym----Hockeye22 and WyomingKnott,\nThank you for your replies. Both of you say to put XP Pro on a HDD, that's what I was thinking too. Can you please give me your input n what follows. My problem is what do I need to do to be able to transfer XP Pro from the IDE to SATA Drive,---THEN MAKE IT WORK. (can't find power adapter for my bidirectional dongle) I figure that dual boot will work, but I don't want to boot from Bios all the time. Are there any (Free) program to multiboot from. Should I copy,clone or, image one drive to the other to use XP Pro? I have both EASY BCD and PWHE that I can use if needed, is there any other program that I might need? (Have not used either yet) I have a lot of 32 bit progams on the old IDE drive that I will more than likely need to delete.(like MS Office 2003) If I make a \"Shared\" programs partition does it matter if it is 32 or 64 bit? I have not installed MS Office 2010 and Norton 360 2012 where should I install them? When I do the clean install of windows to my SSD I'm planning to unplug the other drives so SR partitions is insatalled on SSD. Do I need to worry about adding anything else there? FYI. I want to dabble in Linus OS in the future too. I hope you can hep me with any or all of this..I've read some tutorials but most are not detailed. PS I have all the disks for CAD, XP Pro, etc. but I don't think I can just install them on the sata drive because I don't think I can get pgm keys since programs are 2006 or earler Thanks",
            "WyomingKnott---- Well, aside from the dongle power, I meant to answer that in my first reply: There are solutions for that. One is to use a clone utility, actually backup and restore, that has the option to restore to dissimilar hardware. EASEUS ToDo Backup is free and claims to do this, Acronis True Image is not free and is very popular. The other is to do a straight clone, detach your Win7 drive, boot from the XP CD, and do a Repair Installation. Then you put the Win7 drive back. I wrote in my first post that EasyBCD will let you add the XP boot into your Win7 boot menu. What's installed in one OS won't run in the other. You can't have a shared install between the two, because one of the OSes will be missing the registry entries and so forth. There are a group of recommended tweaks for installations on an SSD, but the only critical things are to disconnect the other drives and set the controller to AHCI mode before installing Win7. Oh, dear. If you set the controller to AHCI mode for Win7, then XP won't boot because it will have the IDE mode drivers. Changing this in XP is a pain; I've done it once and did not enjoy it. Perhaps you have a secondary Marvell controller that could be set to IDE mode and booted from? (NOTE: IDE mode is not an IDE drive; it's a compatibility mode with an SATA drive.) Look for the keys with the CDs. If they came retail, it will be in the packaging. If not, you probably downloaded the keys or got them in Email. I really think that, if you can find them, the simplest thing for you would be to reinstall them in the XP virtual machine. Or, and this is really out there, boot from your old IDE drive using a motherboard that supports IDE drives."

The USB port had several gold pins missing and started smoking (no smoke though, just smell) so i started to wonder whether the enclosure was dead or if the hard drive was dead, I got myself a SATA to USB cable to check but I CANT CRACK THIS HARD DRIVE OPEN NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY. There are no screws anywhere, which is an obvious indication that they don't want you digging in. My hard drive is a Toshiba Canvio something. I don't want to end up in a problem bigger than my current one. I have no idea what to do.",
            "cha11enger----I have a few ideas for what happened and what you can do: First off, if it starts taking more and more pressure to get a device to recognize, stop and check for damaged parts or noticeable difference between a good USB port and a bad one. If you start jamming the USB plugin really hard, your putting your entire computer at risk (that is why you smelt burning smells) and could do absolute nothing, to completely destroying your PC. Don't panic, if your PC is running fine and you don't smell anything anymore, its probably ok, but before you go plugging other devices into that port, I advise you just don't use it. The reason you can't open you Hard Drive is because you probably have a Passport drive (meant for traveling) and is not easily accessible for end-user repairs. anyways, enough with the risk factors, here are some things you could do: 1. Check the cable for repairable pins/plates (the gold stuff you saw was the gold contact plates getting its coating scraped off, which shows that there was a lot of pressure involved) and see if you can (only if you know what you are doing) repair them (unless the cable itself is dead completely). 2. try a different USB port on your computer 3. if the cable itself is replaceable, just replace it with a new one. 3. try a different device in the same port, make sure not to jam it even if it works if you do! 4. take your PC to a repair shop for inspection of both the Hard Drive and PC. 5. little advanced, but quite simple as what this will be about is actually replacing the USB plug on the Hard Drive. (considering this Hard Drive is self powered via the USB cable, this should work. also the fact you got a cable adapter that works the same way, is also a vital component as it will act as the replacement USB Plugin.\nBut, I need more info before I continue. Like, How is the Hard Drive powered? is it a passport drive? Is the cable itself replaceable? how much did you manage to take apart? A little bit more info regarding PC system specs, the Hard Drvie (HDD) info itself etc would be great.",
            "NonCompatiable---- I think you've got the USB Ports confused, i'm talking about the USB Port in the Hard Drive that's smoking, the USB Port in the computer is fine (at least i think) i can plug other stuff in it and they work. Im jamming the end of the USB that goes into the hard drive really hard, not the part that goes into the computer. The cable itself is fine, it's the hard drive USB \"port\" with missing golden pins. I tried a different USB Port and it had zero effect, i'm pretty sure the problem is with the Hard Drive enclosure, since the old USB cable stopped working i said \"cable fault\" i bought a new cable and had it working for a couple of a minutes (with shaking and pushing in) then it failed. As i said before i've tried different devices in the same port, still working. I'd take it to the place i bought it but they said \"i can't get warranty/guarantee with the hard drive\" which means i'll have to take it to some special repair centre or something and shill out a few pounds. The hard drive is powered by a USB, one side fitting in the computer and the other fitting in the USB Slot in the hard drive. The cable itself is replaceable but i do not think it is the cable at fault. I have no idea whether it's a passport or anything, i couldn't take apart anything in fear of making the problem worse than current. my PC is a Windows 10, Asus X Series (not really sure of the number) and i don't really know much about my hard drive, i found a picture of it and some specifications of it too, don't know if it will help, but here goes nothing.. http://www.junglee.com/Toshiba-Canvio-HDTP110AK3AA-2-5-Inch-External/dp/B00BZ0QUN0 Again, i'm pretty sure the problem is with the enclosure and the computer and data is fine.

            "sgtechwork----Experts, I recently purchased a Samsung M2 SSD (256 GB) to replace the current Samsung M2 SSD (128 GB). Due to some reason, the BIOS is not detecting the new SDD. I've initialized and installed windows on the new SSD via both UEFI &amp; Legacy but still ASUS ROG does not recognize it. Though, the same SSD is immediately recognized and booted with other laptops (I've tried HP and Dell with no issues). Today, I realized that the current (SSD which came with the laptop) takes 0.8A power and the new SSD requires 2.91A power. Could this be a reason that the new SSD is not detected since it cannot load without enough power? [EDIT] Does BIOS control power for SSD's?

            "soheipp----Ok so this is an interesting problem. I have a 2TB western digital my passport drive that I keep a lot of media on. Was working fine the other day and when I plugged it in last night, I get nothing. So in summary here are the things I noticed: 1) when plugged into usb, there is no ding chime that you normally get when plugging a usb device\n2) when I plug the drive in, the white light turns on and the drive starts spinning and sounds normal.\n3) I tried the drive on a windows 7 machine and a windows 10 machine. Both computers don't notice the drive. In the past, the drive has been used on both machines.\n4) I tried the usual yada yada like rebooting machine, plugging in after logging on, plugging before turning on etc. nothing worked.\n5) device manager and drive management both do not see the drive. I also downloaded western digital utilities and it also fails to see the drive. so yeah please help. ***UPDATES*** -Tried a new cable and it didn't solve the problem.\n-Arranged for the drive to be seen by a local data recovery company. Will update this thread with what damage is found with the drive and if it is repairable so incase someone else gets these symptoms, they don't have to waste their time and money troubleshooting.\n-Hard drive dropped off at data pro's. The tech said he is 99% sure that the drive suffered a static electricity short to the pcb. Apparently there is circuitry built into the pcb to dissipate this but these components break down over time and lead to drive failure from a short. He said he will be removing the memory chips and transplanting them on a new pcb. Will know in a few days if this is successful.\n-Hard drive picked up today. So there were 2 problems with the drive. First was the controller on the pcb was replaced. Second was a software issue. They weren't very open when I asked them as to what was the exact software issue but they said something along the lines of a ROM software was purchased from western digital and used to recover the data? Regardless, the data recovery was 100% so im happy. Cost $500 for the recovery including a new drive.",

One thing you can try is to get another USB cable and see if the drive would be properly recognized. In case the issue persists and the drive is not recognized by Disk Management and Device Manager, then there is something physically wrong with the enclosure or the HDD itself.

Both could just fail, as any other thing, even if you handle it properly.(drives are really vulnerable to shocks, hits, etc) This is why, no matter the storage device that you got( internal, external or even SSD), you should always store the important data on several places. Let us see if the cable helps. D_Know_WD ",

When I choose the repair option on a installation disc the HDD won't show up in the list, only the SATA one which I don't need at the moment. It's already difficult to get to the repair tool because mouse and keyboard won't work if you don't switch off XHCI Hand-off and turn on Windows 7 Installation in Windows OS Configuration.

You're apparently attempting to install a Win 7 OS onto a newly-built PC. You say you \"tried to plug in my USB-HDD with Windows 7\" presumably to install the OS. Does this external USB HDD contain the MS Win 7 installation setup files? Or are you indicating this drive contains a Win 7 OS? 2.

Are you indicating you're using components in this new build cannibalized from \"other PCs\"? If so, I trust one of them isn't your MSI motherboard! 3.

The problem is that I can`t boot from the USB-HDD, because it just shows a bluescreen after it shows the Windows flag.\nBooting from the USB worked on other PCs, and no parts of them were used to build the new one.",

I have bought a seperate winkey for the USB-HDD. The OS was fully installed with WinToUSB, just like on a internal HDD (windows doesnt allow you to install on usb hard drives) For the new, MSI PC I used another key (which was used on the old Dell), and I installed Windows with a Dell OEM CD, it works fine so I dont bother about the new installation."

But you have to figure that the engineers at WD who designed the drive - who know better than random people on the Internet speculating - knew what they were doing when they added the \"feature.\" They wouldn't have done it if they knew it would significantly impact drive longevity (although I suppose it's always possible Management overrode them and forced them to do it). The head parking does cause other issues, particularly if you're using it as a system drive or for storing your game programs (causes stuttering of the screen and mouse pointer). But if you're only using it for storage, and move any data you use frequently to your SSD first, you should be fine. Just be sure not to put a pagefile on it. Worst case, what, you're out $10-$15?",

Also, don't focus so much on the peak speeds. They rarely matter unless you're copying lots of big files (e.g. copying your movies folder). The 4k and 4kQ32 speeds are much more important, as they reflect how fast the drive is when it's working with lots of small files.

Usually the dual channel memory slots share the same color. So make sure your DIMMs are in two slots with the same color and you're good. Yes those are very good speeds. In fact after seeing it I'm thinking maybe my next SSD should be a Sandisk Extreme II. The 4k read speed is slightly below average, but that 4k write speed is more than double the average for a SSD. Don't worry about it being slightly slower than 550 MB/s. The MB/s scale is the inverse of your sense of speed (\"how long does it take to copy a file?\"). So the bigger the MB/s, the less it matters. 100 vs 102 MB/s makes a bigger difference than 500 vs 550 MB/s.",

This could account for the BIOS recognizing the drive but not the OS. Your post is conflicting on the following portion: The hard drive is recognized in the BIOS as a SATA but is not recognized when I power on the PC.. When you say power on the PC do you actually mean try to load the OS?? Please elaborate. And Microsoft will continue to support XP until 2014, so it's still a viable OS for now.",

The problem is that XP only knows how to deal with optical drives, floppies and IDE hard drive, but NOT SATA or AHCI drives. One solution is to use a standard Windows process early in the Install routine to install an AHCI driver from a floppy. But many don't have one in the machine. That is why BIOS makers included a special feature for SATA ports. Go into your BIOS Setup screens and look for where the SATA ports are set up. Make sure they are Enabled. Then look close to there for port mode settings. Choices usually are IDE (or PATA) Emulation, SATA, AHCI, or RAID. Set it to IDE (or PATA) Emulation and the BIOS will make the real SATA drive look like a plain IDE drive, and Win XP will Install happily.",

Nevertheless, I am wondering if there is any advantage to use multiple M.2 SSD (boot and storage drive separated) compared to a single M.2 SSD (boot and storage drive not separated). Does two M.2 NVMe SSD have any advantage over a single M2. NVMe SSD? If I use multiple M.2 SSD, will it better to have the faster M.2 SSD as boot drive or as storage drive? An issue here is, that the M.2 SSD with smaller capacity has less speed than the SSD with higher capacity (240GB &lt; 500 GB &lt; 1 TB). If I just use one M.2 SSD, does partition it affect its performance? Can I freely partition a M.2 SSD with disk management? For example, can I just partition my 1 TB M.2 SSD to 188 GB and 812 GB?

            "Skorp62----To address your question directly about two NVMe drives: What most people fail to mention is that the awesome speed of an NVMe drive is derived from the direct connection to the CPU's PCIe buss. Most motherboards only have one slot connected directly. The other M2 slot is serviced by the motherboard's chipset which will reduced the speed gains (and usually share bandwidth with your SATA Ports). In order to install two NVMe drives and realize the massive speed gains of both, you would have to add a PCIe adater board for the second NVMe drive. These are usually only about $20.00; so that is your decision. To address partitioning of NVMe drives: The larger the drive, the more overhead in addressing it, which also decreases speed a little bit - but pretty much insignificant. Your idea to have a smaller, 512 GB boot / swap NVMe and then a larger 1 TB storage drive is a very common choice. During partitioning, it is still recommended to leave approximately 10% of the drive space \"unallocated\" to compensate for the ageing of the drive. In your case, 450 GB for the boot drive and 900GB for the storage drive. I will assume that you have already purchased the drives, but if you have not, you can save some money by just using standard SSD instead of NVMe. In \"normal\" private use, you would most likely not be impacted by the speed difference, even though it looks massive on paper."

Windows on the other hand will usually attempt a graceful failure (the BSOD message that you're getting) when it cannot read or write from the system drive. In all likelihood the drive has already been damaged beyond full recovery so what you need to do ASAP is get PartedMagic and burn it to a CD (use another computer to do this if you can). Parted magic is a linux LiveCD that is very useful for doing system maintenance and recovery. Use it to mount the system disk and backup whatever crucial information that you want kept to an external storage device. If you do not need to back anything up you can skip this step.

            "j_chatelain----So, I've purchased my first set of SSDs with the intention of putting them in RAID 0 and using it as my boot drive. But alas, I've run into a problem. Hopefully I'm overlooking something, so I'll start with my specs: Windows 7 64 Pro\nFoxconn A79A-S motherboard\nPhII 940\n2 x 40 gb Intel X-25V SSDs\n2 x 1 tb HDD (1 WB &amp; 1 Hitachi) All four drives show up in my BIOS. When I set th SATA type option to RAID (as instructed by the manual) and reboot, I am taken to the RAID utility screen. From here, I try to set up RAID 0, but only the two HDDs show up. I tried this procedure several times, but with the same results. I went ahead an installed Win7 on one of the SSDs, which went smoothly. All four drives are recognized in Windows as well. I download and applied the Intel firmware update to both drives, tried the RAID steps again, and still failed to see them as an option. Like I said, hopefully I am missing an obvious step, as this is my first time dabbling in RAID. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
            "sminlal----You need to use the BIOS to actually configure the two SSDs as a RAID volume before Windows will be able to see them. It's more than just selecting \"RAID\" as the mode for the controller, you have to actually tell it to select both SSDs and configure them as RAID 0. Once you've done this you should be able to see them in the Windows installation screen.",
            "j_chatelain----Sorry, I wasn't very clear in my decription. The 'RAID utilty screen' I mentioned is actually called Option ROM utility, and is still part of the BIOS. This is where I have no option to select the SSDs, only the HDDs, when I am asked to select which drives I want for RAID 0. Also, my BIOS and drivers are up to date.",

Now I don't use this as a backup drive, it's there to give me some extra storage space, so it get's accessed frequently.\nSolutions tried so far:\n1&gt; Put computer to high performance power profile, no go.\n2&gt; Disabled USB selective suspend, no go.\n3&gt; Disabled \"Turn off hard disks after\" in power options, no go.\nAnd this is what finally solved the spin down problem:-\n4&gt; Open REGEDIT as administrator.

This seems like a tedious process, and I assume most people who don't read forums like Tom's, won't bother with regedit. So, is there an easier way to achieve this feat? Or is it okay for the hard drive to spin down after every 5 minutes, only to spin up again after another 2 minutes, constantly spinning up and down a hundred times all thru the day?\nThee HDD is Seagate Expansion, connected to a USB3 port.

            "urbanrider----Don’t worry about it. The HDD was designed to operate like this to save power etc. While technically the spin cycle is hard on the disk it would most likely wear out quicker if it was continually running all the time. There are arguments from both sides with no real concrete evidence that points either way. Now if it’s just about it being annoying there are a few “safer” ways than just saying that its always on. The easiest way is to have something on that drive that gets accessed about every &lt;5 min, I have a few programs that are always running, so my drives rarely spin down because they are always being accessed.\nIf you don’t have a program like that, you could write a quick script that writes a temporary file to the drive ever 4 min when you’re using the computer.",

Then I came upon a Toms review which has me thinking that the 250Gb size does not perform. Do I need to use a 500/512Gb drive for the boot? Is there an alternative M.2 drive around the 250Gb size that is going to work well for me? http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/samsung-960-evo-nvme-ssd-review,4802.html",
            "CountMike----I have 250GB 960 Evo, it's few times faster than my other SSDs but there's no visible difference in booting speed, maybe a second or 2 less than my older Kingston V300 with 120GB or Silicone Power 240GB. Speed not withstanding, it may still be better to go for larger size because space can bleed out pretty fast.",
            "trevor_dennis----Thanks for the feedback. I use my rigs for Photoshop and video editing, which uses a lot of space so I use WinDirStat to keep the boot drive under control, and move My Docs, Desktop, Downloads, various cache, iTunes backup, Outlook pst file etc. to a second 250Gb SSD. wITH Hybernate turned off, that keeps the boot drive down to around 180Gb. In fact Windows died on me recently, and it made it super easy to reinstall because I didn't need any files from the C:/ drive. So it feels like a pity to use a 500Gb drive and never use most of it. I guess I could leave some of that stuff on the C:/ drive and rely on backups. (I currently use 15 drives in all including four SSDs and seven USB3.0 for backup and non essential files.) I am still not sure if the Samsung 250Gb NVMe drives under-perform compared to the larger sizes, but that's what I am getting from the Toms article. For the sake of $200 I am inclined to use the 500Gb drive for the Boot and suck up the wasted space.",
            "hoggyy---- Don't look at it as wasted space.. That extra space will allow for many more write cycles as the wear leveling algorithms move stuff around. Not only that, it is often said performance can suffer if the drive is over x% filled. Not sure how much that still applies to a Samsung 960 Pro NvME drive, but still something to consider nonetheless.",
            "The Original Ralph----trevor_dennis - I've got a Samsung 950 PRO &amp; 960 EVO - as CountMike said, there's a small difference in boot times but what is faster is opening larger programs - i'm still running Adobe Photoshop CS3 and it amazes me how much faster it loads from the PCIe drives - about 6-7 seconds compared to my sata SSDs. I also render a lot of video files, and it knocked a considerable amount of time off my render times, especially when reading the video file from one PCIe drive and writing to a second PCIe drive. What someone suggested about the 500GB drive - go for it, I use it for my OS drive but it gave me room to partion 250 GBs for a video \"worktable\" partition. I put the file i'm rendering on it, and write to a second dedicated PCIe drive i use for my second video \"worktable\". With the 10 cores in that 7900x i suspect the video files will be smoking going thru rendering. That ought to be an awesome rig - i'm also running an Asrock mobo and couldn't be happier with it - absolutely stable, where another rig i've got with a ASUS likes to have it's BIOS refreshed 1x or more times a year. The odd part is ASUS owns Asrock - go figure suggestion - stretch your budget and go for minimum 64 GBs of ram, if not more - that way you can buy a matched set of sticks. I originally started with 32 GB, and then had to had another 32 GB - it was too much hassle to sell my first two sticks, so i took a chance there wouldn't be a conflict with the second set not matching whatever electronic values they use to match sticks at the factory 2nd suggestion, whatever memory you go with, don't waste coin on the \"latest &amp; greatest\" - i picked up 3200 MHz Ram only to learn i hadn't noticed on the spec sheet my 5960X was limited to 2600."

XP and earlier versions of Windows could only be installed on the boot drive. So your HDD has the actual bootstrap. It contains a simple program which says \"look for Windows on this drive (the HDD) and the D: drive (the SSD).\" The SSD has no bootstrap, so if you remove the HDD the system won't boot. The surefire fix is to remove the HDD from the system, and reinstall Windows onto the SSD. If you want, you can remove the HDD, boot off the install DVD, and attempt a repair on the SSD. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. Then you change your BIOS settings to make the SSD the first bootable drive. Finally you can put the HDD back into the computer, open up Disk Management, and delete every partition on the sucker. This will get rid of the old bootstrap and eliminate the possibility of getting weird hard-to-diagnose symptoms should the SSD become flaky, because the computer has reverted to booting off the HDD again."

I think that the best thing to do is to use another system to try and see if they will be properly recognized, just as @drtweak suggested. If you are unable to do that, I'd recommend you to try using a SATA-to-USB cable or a docking station and connect the HDDs externally. Have you tried resetting BIOS by re-seating the CMOS battery on the motherboard? Here's a tutorial that might help you with that: http://www.wikihow.com/Reset-Your-BIOS (keep in mind that this would get your BIOS settings back to factory defaults, so make sure you know how to re-configure them afterwards). You also mentioned that the replacement WD Black drives actually do power up, so maybe you could try using WD's Data LifeGuard to test them and check up on their SMART data status.

Googled the error and found that it was most likely either the drive or the sata cable. In an attempt to change the variables I tried to install Ubuntu from a live cd I had lying around and the computer just went black after the post. Continuing on my variable changing course I moved the drive into a fully functioning tower, disconnected its drive to make sure nothing got changed and tried to install Windows on the drive thinking that if I could get it installed I could just switch it back, install the correct drivers and everything would be peachy. Ended up getting the same error (0x80070057) so it must be the hard drive as the sata cable in the other tower had been functioning perfectly for over a year. Is there anything I haven't thought of or read on here about this issue? It seems odd that a brand new barracuda is DOA. My only other thought was that maybe the Windows 8.1 iso might not have the sata driver I need but I wouldn't have a clue where to find this driver, I assume drivers can be loaded through USB during the partition stage of installation. The HDD is going to be returned for a WD black although I have seen the same posts involving WD drives also. New sata cables will be coming with it also just in case. My apologies for the essay but I tried to answer all the basic questions I have seen in the various posts on this error so no one directs me to the Microsoft website page on the error code.

I thought it was interesting (I built it over a year ago, but it's never crashed without an obvious reason), but I rebooted and went about my business. The next day I get home from work and a text file is up on the screen with one of my wife's normal messages. So, I close the out Word and it happens again. Frozen. I reboot it and it seems to be booting extremely slow. It boots fine, but not until after I decide to leave it for about 5 minutes. Over the course of the day, while trying to diagnose the issue, it seems to be getting worse. Until eventually the BIOS isn't recognizing the hard drive at all. I was seriously hoping that maybe it was a motherboard or PSU issue, but I've been using Ubuntu (installed on an 80GB SSD and an old 320GB HDD) fine since removing it and it my wife's PC wouldn't recognize it. Anyway, that's one of the interesting things. What happened was I hooked it up to my wife's PC, it wasn't recognized by the BIOS, and so I just gave up and went to bed. The next morning my wife is asking me how I messed up her PC. I told her that I didn't do anything to her PC, thinking that she was just referring to the fact that I left the side of it open. But then she starts telling me that while trying to stream some games with her brother last night, it kept crashing every few minutes. So, I remove the hard drive, thinking that's weird as heck. Now, after removing the seemingly dead hard drive, her PC is back to working perfectly fine. I tried it again, just to see if it wasn't a fluke, and it's repeatable.

Anyways, I settled for a nice $850 dell laptop that comes with a 256 GB SSD and I was wondering how I would go about transferring my 750 GB HDD from my old laptop to the new laptop to use as a secondary drive. How can I wipe everything from it? I know how to install it and everything but is there anything special I need to do before I install it?",

Running some third party tools on the drive would not hurt as well: http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/282651-32-best-diagnostic-testing-utility What is the file format of the drive? You can check that out under Disk Management. If it is something different than NTFS, you can back up the data stored over there and reformat it to NTFS. Do you have a spare USB cable lying around? In case you do, it would not really hurt to attach the drive with that one. You can try it on another computer as well. That way, you will rule out a possible power related cause. If none of these work, then I believe you can just contact the place you got it from or WD's Support and eventually RMA the drive: https://support.wdc.com/contact.aspx Let me know in case you have some more questions,\nD_Know_WD ",

        "usercomment": [
            "blader1176----First off, my knowledge on how USB ports work is fairly limited, which is probably why I'm running into this issue that is likely an easy fix. I ordered a 320GB USB 3.0 external hard drive and I have encountered an issue with the transfer speed, finding it excruciatingly slow, much slower than (I think) it should be. It starts at about 200 mb/s and gets slower and slower as the transfer of a file continues, until it halts at 1.5kb/s. I know that 3.0 hard drives are backwards compatible with 2.0 USB ports (and that the transfer speed is capped at whatever the port's is). However, after messing around with my device manager a little, it looks like my computer doesn't have any active USB 2.0 ports. My motherboard specifications state that I have 14 USB 2.0/1.1 ports. I can see 12, two on the side and 10 on the back of the computer. What confuses me is that since the motherboard's specification page states that they are 2.0/1.1 ports, I'm guessing there's a way to switch in between them? If so, then it looks like they're only functioning as USB 1.1 ports. This picture indicates the two controllers and two hubs that appear to be 2.0. If you're numbering the controllers from 1-9, numbers 1,2, and 6 seem to be completely unused. However, all of the rest operate two usb ports each, which I found by inserting my mouse's USB into all of them and checking which ones used bandwidth for the mouse (I'm sure there was an easier way of finding this out, but whatever).This final picture shows that both of the 2.0 hubs have 14 ports total that are not being used. If there is any other information I can provide, let me know. TL;DR: My computer's USB ports seem to have both 1.1 and 2.0 functionality, but after witnessing the painfully slow transfer speed of my new hard drive and looking around in device manager, I think that the ports are only working as USB 1.1 ports. Things I've tried: Messing around in BIOS - My only USB related options in BIOS are \"USB Controller\" and two Legacy related settings, and I believe USB Controller is the most relevant. However, there are only two settings for it, \"Enabled\" and \"Disabled\" (was already enabled by default). I've messed with the legacy settings as well, to no avail. I have also flashed BIOS to a newer version to see if that option would be available, it was not. Downloading the latest drivers - I updated chipset drivers as well as SATA related stuff. No luck. I have tried to take a look inside the computer without opening it, which I feel like I'm going to do anyways eventually. Only useful thing I could find was there was a cable come from one of these (marked by the red box) that was labeled \"USB 2.0\" and I think that it's an \"internal header\" but I don't really know all the details of what it does, I also couldn't see the other end of it. ",
            "andy_Man----Try taking your front panel usb header, moving it to the internal usb header you circled in red. Then only connect the hard drive to it. USB will share it's bandwidth with other devices plugged into the same header. If that doesn't help, mebbie a pci-e based usb 3 board.",
            "andy_Man----Something along the lines of this, might help. However, usb 2.0 should give you more than 15k\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=14G-0001-00013",
            "Vlad Rose----I know this may be a dumb question, but is the external hard drive plugged directly into the motherboard's usb port or are you going through a hub? The reason I am asking is that while the motherboard port could be USB 2.0, the hub may not be; if you're using one. The other thing is the cable you're using to connect to the motherboard a 2.0 header cable? If it's a USB port from your computer case plugged into the motherboard, it may not necessarily support 2.0. I have an old computer case at home on my older machine that suffers with that issue myself.",
            "blader1176----Alright, so I took a look inside my computer and messed around a bit. @andy it turns out, the cable labeled \"USB 2.0\" went straight to my front USB ports. There's even a \"USB 2.0\" label on the plastic piece that attaches right into the back of the USB ports in the front of the computer. Still, those two ports are 1.1. I even attached the motherboard-end of the cable to the other blue port, the one directly below the one I circled in red before, that didn't really change anything. @Vlad I've used the external hard drive in all of my USB ports, and none of them are substantially faster than any of the others. I have to front ports on my computer case, and 10 in the back that are on the motherboard. I really wish there was just a way to easily reassign a root hub or controller to a physical port. I have the 2.0 root hubs, but none of my ports are using them (hence why they say there are 14 open ports total)."

I found a bunch of these on Newegg in the 500-512 GB range all for the same price: Newegg M2 SSDs So I was particularly interested in the ADATA 512 GB one since for the same price it's 12 GB larger than the others. How big are these SSD's though? I know the actual storage space is different than what's advertised and I saw this listing on Amazon for another SSD advertised as 512 GB but then in parenthesis says 480 GB. So with that in mind, is the ADATA SSD really bigger than all the other 500 GB SSD's? How much space is actually on each SSD?

Then , i cloned my hdd into my ssd with the Acronis program and at the end of the cloning , it was written on the screen that it was gonna shutdown in 1 second but freezed this way for like 10 minutes , so i just shutted down the pc . When i opened my pc , it shows the cloning was succesful with all the files on the ssd. then i proceded to shut the pc again so i could go in the bios and set it as my boot drives , but each time i tried to boot windows 10 with it , the screen just flash and i can't do anything and its just showing the classic windows 10 screen with the background and it just won't go farther than that . But then when i try to boot it with my hdd , absolutely zero problem . I tried for hours to change some settings but nothing happens , same flashing screen that won't go further than the home screen flashing ( in a irregular way) So yeah im pretty frustrated right now , but hopefully some of you could suggest some solutions .\nMaybe its the cloning at the end that changed it all , but ill try it again and trying to sucessflully install it without the shut down bug at the end . So yeah does somebody have an idea ?\nsome more detail:\n- Once i unplugged my hdd totally so it could only possibly boot on the ssd but instead of a flashing home screen , it just showed nothing except the cursor moving around normally .",

            "daniel2003489----The title really explains it. I have been trying to throw another HDD in my PC for the past few weeks. So, I found 2 Spare HDDs I had in my box, which worked fine in other PCs. So, I throw the First one (Seagate Barracuda 250 GB HDD) in. It works fine for about, the first 10 minutes, then COMPLETELY stops working, BIOS, nor Windows recognizes it. so I throw the Second one in (Toshiba 500 GB SATA 6GB/s), It works for about an hour. Then it fails, and starts making noises. So, I open it, and it is making a ticking noise every 2 seconds. And then I try to start it up, again, and it makes LOUD noises, and leaves about 50 surface scratches on the disk. Now, for the 3rd HDD. A Western Digital Caviar Blue SATA 3GB/S 500 GB HDD. I bought it on Ebay. I put it in the computer, it works great for the first day and a half. Then it slowly started dying, similar to my Toshiba drive. Then it dies COMPLETELY, just like the Toshiba. Then it starts making noises, just like the Toshiba. I open it, and ho ho, what do you know. Surface Scratches, Everywhere. So out of Curiosity, I open it, start it one more time. And then, something.... strange happens. It starts ticking, then all of a sudden, the top Read/Write arm almost completely rips it's head off, leaving more scratches, and a useless HDD. I have disassembled both drives, not the Seagate, however. I am thinking it may have something to do with the power, maybe? I am not sure. An Idea of what the hell is going on would be FANTASTIC.

            "humdinger5714----Hello everyone! Hoping for some advice regarding a Seagate NAS. I have the Seagate NAS 2-Bay, 4-Bay Drive Model #STCT100. Inside, I have two HGST Deskstar 3TB 7,200 RPM SATA III 6Gb/s 3.5\" NAS Hard drives. Both the Seagate NAS and hard drives have been rock solid running flawlessly for over 6 amazing years. The NAS drive formats the hard drives into a SimplyRAID format (https://www.seagate.com/manuals/network-storage/business-storage-nas-os/raid-modes/) So, my issue is that I accidentally deleted some data off my NAS drive. Totally my fault, user error. What I’m looking for help with is: Is there any recovery software out there that can actually search for deleted files as mapped network drives? Or do all of them require you to basically pop out the NAS drive, and then connect it via a USB enclosure so that it appears as a local drive in the Operating System? I have not found one instance of recovery software that can attempt to do this “over the network”? Does something like this exist? If not, looking for experienced recommendations on affordable and effective recovery software. Obviously something that is compatible with the SimplyRAID format and something you had good success with. Although there is a “Sticky” thread here that suggests Recuva and a few others, that was posted in 2013. So just curious to see what other recommendations others might have. Well, thanks kindly for your time and any suggestions you can help provide!",
            "humdinger5714----Anyone?",
            "DSzymborski----I'm not familiar with any that do this. Recovering deleted files from a RAID is a nightmare in even the best of circumstances. To try to recover from a proprietary RAID alternative over a network? That's seventh circle of Hell stuff. This is kind of the problem with RAID and why it's a bad idea except for very specific cases in w which availability of large sequential files is more important than data integrity. And anyone use RAID should also have a separate backup plan, because RAID is not a backup strategy.",
            "USAFRet----That is not going to work. Take a drive out and connect to to a regular PC, either internally or externally, and Windows will almost certainly want to reformat it. For Recuva and similar, doubtful that would work either.\nYou could try it, though.",
            "Alabalcho----You need a Linux PC where to connect the NAS drive(s). There's good chance the RAID is set as LVM, and you need actually to recreate and mount it before using any recovery tools. Another option is to see whether you can get command-line access to the NAS, and how to build (that's right - you need to compile from sources) the chosen recovery tool for your NAS. Unless someone has already done this, this is much harder than booting Linux Distro off USB/DVD. You can try Knoppix for that, there are plenty of reconvery tools already there."

            "scott.r.troyer----I am attempting to upgrade to a larger HDD. I have cloned my 1 TB Western Digital WD Blue HDD to my new 4 TB Seagate BarraCuda HDD using Macrium Reflect (because it is free). Because I am running windows 10, my HDD has a recovery volume to the right of my C drive. This means that cannot use Macrium to extend my C volume to include the unallocated space. I have tried only cloning the system reserve and C volumes, but Windows will not boot unless I clone all three. I have already tried using a USB device to create a temporary recovery drive until I can get the Seagate drive set, and then let Windows create a new recovery volume to the right of the newly expanded C drive; however, Windows refuses to boot properly, and then wants me to reinstall, deleting all my programs, another headache that I would prefer not to have to deal with.\nCurrently, I am trying to use my trial version of EaseUs Partition Master to move the unallocated space to the left of the recovery volume. Unfortunately, the program will only allow me to move 1.07 TB of unallocated space into position. 1.66 TB remains to the right of the recover volume and will not move. Oddly enough, Windows disk management has been showing two blocks of unallocated space of the same size as well.\nSo, given my situation, how can I expand my main (C) drive to include all the unallocated space on my new HDD without deleting the recovery volume that windows will not operate without?

            "ArtPog----Something is amiss in your description of your drives' configuration So perhaps you may want to clarify it since it has a bearing on your situation. From the screenshots you submitted it would tend to indicate that that the former boot drive, i.e., the 1 TB HDD had been MBR-partitioned and apparently was running the Win 7 OS. (I'm basing that on the existence of the 100 MB System Reserved partition - the typical size for Win 7 OSs). Yet you state the cloned 4 TB HDD is running the Win 10 OS. Can you clarify this? Are you indicating that following the disk-cloning operation you upgraded the Win 7 OS on the 4 TB destination drive to the Win 10 OS? (This has a bearing on your basic question re utilizing the entire disk-space of the 4 TB boot drive.)\n",
            "scott.r.troyer---- Thanks for responding! The old drive was running windows 10. I had upgraded it from windows 7 to windows 10 a year ago. Is it possible that the upgrade left the Windows 7 partition on the old drive? All I have attempted to do on the destination drive is incorporate the unallocated space into the main volume.",
            "ArtPog----1. OK. That explains it. I think you may be in luck. 2. I'm using your screenshot of Disk Management as the present configuration of your 4 TB boot drive. 3. Your initial problem is that the drive has been MBR-partitioned presumably because the 1 TB source drive whose contents were cloned to the 4 TB destination HDD was MBR-partitioned. Ordinarily (with most disk-cloning programs) the partitioning scheme is also cloned over to the destination drive, regardless of whether the latter had been GPT-partitioned prior to the d-c operation. 4. So the upshot of this is that currently the 4 TB boot drive is also MBR-partitioned, and as such, contains only about 2+ TB of available usable disk-space. The 3.63 TB of total disk-space on that drive is unavailable to the user because of the MBR-partitioning. Presently the 1678 GB of unallocated disk-space (note DM) will be unavailable. 5. Fortunately, because the drive contains a bootable Win 10 OS you will be able to convert the drive to the GPT-partitioning scheme without the loss of data. I'm assuming that your current Win 10 OS contains the recent updates to this OS. If not, ensure that it does. 6. Win 10 now contains that MBR2GPT conversion tool. It's a built-in utility to simply convert the drive from MBR to GPT. That will be your first step. You should do a Google search on \"using the Windows 10 MBR2GPT conversion tool\" for details on this process. Generally it's quite simple. The basic command from an Admin Prompt is...mbr2gpt /convert /disk:0 /allowfullos (assumes the 4 TB HDD you are converting is Disk 0) But read about that conversion utility before using it. 7. Now after the drive has been GPT-partitioned and the entire disk-space is available to you, the next step is to delete the 450 MB Recovery Partition. The likelihood is you will not be able to do so by simply using Disk Management although sometimes for reasons unfathomable to us DM doesn't balk at the normal deletion process. But the likelihood is you will need to use DiskPart to delete that partition. I would hope you're familiar with that valuable Windows utility. The final DiskPart command (after selecting the Recovery Partition) is: \"delete partition override\". (no quotes). If you're not familiar with DiskPart, do a Google search; it's a utility you should be familiar with. 8. So after the deletion of the RP you will be able to use Disk Management to extend your C partition to encompass whatever portion of the unallocated disk-space you desire...all of it if that's what you want. 9. I trust in the days &amp; months ahead you will use whatever backup strategy you prefer to COMPREHENSIVELY back up your system from time-to-time so that you always have the means to return your system to a functional state in the event disaster strikes in the form of a defective boot drive or a corrupted OS. We generally employ a disk-cloning program for this purpose; use whatever type of program/process suits you.",

            "Evockzi----I am a soon to be a Owner of a purdy Asrock Extreme7 gen3 Z68 board. Which has the SSD Caching feature, now SSD caching isn't perfect and I ideally want the best of both worlds of a Pure SSD rig and the overall performance of a average SSD rig in alot of everyday tasks. So I have recently purchased, Patriot Torqx 2 32GB\nhttp://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220580\n( I got a good deal on with a 20$ promo code, since this drive has great write speeds.) OCZ Agility 3 60GB\nhttp://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227725 Now my plan was to have the OCZ as the primary drive, with OS and important games installed on.\nAnd have the Patriot as the cache. Now There is a Very big difference between Sata 2 and 3 speeds obviously. This is where I am worried, as I only want the cache drive to be caching things off my 1TB WD Black, not off of the faster OCZ SSD. Thoughts?? ",
            "chesteracorgi----My question is: what do you think will be the advantage of caching the HDD to the SSD when you have the boot SSD? When you boot from the SATA 6.0 drive you will be getting the fastest load of your OS. After boot up, you will need to load (non-SSD) apps from the HDD. If the HDD is caching to the small SSD the speed will be slightly longer than a direct boot from the SSD. In other words the data flow starts with a read from the HDD, is transmitted to the cache to the SSD and then loaded to RAM. If the same commands or data needs to be accessed it is in the cache if it was a recent instruction call. Some improved speed there, but not a lot (as you have 8 GB of RAM for instructions to be stored in). Plus you will have the overhead of read-writes between the cache on the SSD and the HDD to keep changes refreshed. You will run a risk of data loss because of caching in a system crash. In short, I don't see any advantage to your proposed setup, and some additional risk. And, what processor do you plan to run? The i7 860 is not compatible with LGA 1155 (the Z68 mobo)?",
            "Evockzi----Ah I'm not that active on Tom's I haven't kept my Rig up to date, but ya I was just gonna jam my i7 860 into the board and see what happens I'm about to upgrade to, CPU: i7 2600k (Coolit Vantage ALC P/P) MOBO: Asrock Extreme7 Gen3 Z68 GPU: PCS+ 6950 Vortex II CF (850/1300) RAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance 1600 PSU: Corsair 850HX + 600V2 HDD: 1TB WD Black + 60GB S3 + 30GB S2 SSD's. I will get most of my performance yes from the main SSD, which has OS and primary games on it. And I planned to use the Cache SSD to speed up commonly used applications of the HDD which I know does work just takes a couple of runs, which would still be better in my mind then using that SSD as a pure storage as long as it isn't caching off of the primary but instead the Secondary HDD ",
            "chesteracorgi----I have not heard of anyone using both a cached HDD to SSD and a boot SSD, and don't see any advantage to such a setup. A cached HDD/SSD setup speeds up the system by having the most commonly used program calls present in the cache: it doesn't speed up initial program calls. So say the system says \"write x to screen.\" This instruction will be sped up only after an initial call. Subsequent calls of \"write x to screen will be speedier than the initial call, but not calls like \"play sound y on the sound processor.\" The second instruction will be sped up only after an initial call. If your caching SSD has a transfer rate of 250 MBps and your HDD has a transfer rate of 50 MBps then the initial instruction call will have to go to the HDD and transfer it to the cache of the SSD before it can execute the initial call. All subsequent calls of the same instruction will be at the SSD speed if the cache has not been flushed. However, a lot of instructions persist in RAM. If an instruction stays in RAM it will be magnitudes faster than even going to the SSD. Again, I am not certain that the Z68 can set up both a boot SSD and a caching SSD. But, assuming it can, you would be much better off (in performance) buying either a larger SSD or using multiple SSDs without caching, for those critical apps with which you want fast loads. Caching is slower than solid state. If you want to improve system performance with large apps (that require a lot of RAM) then the better solution is to add more RAM. Similarly, if you want fast loading apps from a HDD, the optimal solution is RAM caching to a virtual drive (more commonly known as a RAM disk). Say you max out your mobo at the 32 GB of RAM it can hold, you can build a virtual RAM disk of 16 GB to hold your most used calls. This is hundreds of times faster than either a SSD or a HDD. But it is risky too as a system crash will cause the RAM drive to disappear and it will have to be rebuilt from scratch. Perhaps a better idea for the second SSD would be to store some apps that you want to load to a RAM disk. You could create a 8 GB RAM disk, with an automatic load routine at boot up from the SATA 3.0GBps SSD. Alternatively, you could use the smaller SSD as your memory/disk cache for windows. Either of these strategies would give (I think) better results than your proposal. In any case, good luck.",
            "Evockzi----The only case where I can find something that would work with the Z68 would be if I can target the Cache SSD to only affect say the non-primary HDD, then I would have a increased performance on applications I use from it. Yes. But if there isn't this option then I'm likely screwed in that respect and will be forced to use it as a games drive. Does anyone know if using SRT technology I can target specifically the HDD and ignore the primary drive?"

Second copy of those files on an external HDD, quite possibly using a specific HDD of your own choice, rather than an external \"backup HDD\" in a pre-packaged enclosure as sold by WD or Seagate, where you DON'T get to choose the HDD inside it. All of the above assumes SSDs are not within budget.",
            "NoGagMaestro----The files I currently have on storage are not 4k files. They are old tv shows from 80s, 90s and 2000s. Some are blu ray rips/remux files but most are not. I'm just worried about 4k playback going forward. Like if I playback a 4k movie file that is 40 or more gb will it playback better on ssd or is hdd ok. I'm just asking does it make a difference so I know if I can buy a bigger hdd to hold more space or will I need to stick to ssd . I don't keep movies, so once I view the movie it will be deleted so I don't plan on growing anymore storage devices. Actually once I finally get around to viewing all the shows I have they will probably be deleted as well except a handful that are my fave. Hopefully I've explained it better now.",
            "Lafong----\nI'd assume 4k playback requirements are fairly well known in some circles or forums. Don't know myself. You can get 4 TB SSD for around 250 now. If that is plenty of capacity for you going forward, I'd strongly consider that rather than any further investment in HDD. My current 3 TB HDD is 7 years old and I've decided I'll never buy more HDD. Maybe a 170 dollar difference between HDD and SDD at the 4 TB capacity level. You're the best judge of your future capacity requirements. If you can get by with HDD for now, maybe cross the 4K bridge when it is actually in your lap....rather than off in the future somewhere. For all I know, you don't need more than 2 TB SSD, which is under $150.",
            "NoGagMaestro----You're right, I can test it once I put the new pc together and then decide on storage from there. I just don't want to spend that much on ssd when it will come down later in the year. Thanks"

            "deewinc----Hello guys, Today early morning (around 2am) went to bed after switching off my laptop. Around 10am, I tried to switch it on but the laptop refused to start. It was fully charged at the time of switching off. Tried to connect the charger and not even the charging LED works. Went to YouTube. Attemped common DIYs like dumping off the static charge and bios reset. But still it won’t work. I have decided to remove the HDD and slot it on the PC. The PC’s SATA HDD is rated 12v or 5v (it can work with either). The Laptop’s SATA HDD is rated 5v. Here’s the challenge, I need to ensure that the HDD’s power cable on the PC does not have a 12v connector (if it does, I cut it off). From forums, the 12v connector is indicated by a wire of color yellow and/or blue for -ve12v. On my PC’s SATA power cable, I don’t have a yellow and/or blue wire. The SATA cable has a white wire. { \"lightbox_close\": \"Close\", \"lightbox_next\": \"Next\", \"lightbox_previous\": \"Previous\", \"lightbox_error\": \"The requested content cannot be loaded.

Lucky, it seems the White cable is -ve5. So, the HDD was spared from proper frying. I decided to look up online on why it fails to boot. Found somewhere where they stated that, trying to boot a laptop's HDD that came preinstalled with Windows on a different PC of a different model other than the exact one of the laptop, won't work. I decided to confirm if the laptop's HDD is okay or fried. Could see it via Bios on the Desktop but decided to check it via Windows. It works.

My BIOS can see it just fine under my NVME Configuration menu options, and also the BIOS function to do a controller test for this disk passes without a problem. However, in Windows 10 x64 (up to date) I am unable to see the disk in Device Manager, or Computer Management / Disk Management section - meaning I can't initialize and format the drive. This is a second NVME disk in this system. My first one which is also the boot/system disk is a Samsung Evo 970 Plus (also seen in the BIOS, right next to the PNY) and functions properly in Windows.

Initially I was thinking this to be a driver issue of some sort, since the BIOS can see the PNY just fine but Windows can not. I also made sure I installed the latest available chipset and SATA drivers (I know its NVME, but still.. ) from my motherboard manufacturer: ASUS, at https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/PRIME-X570-PRO/HelpDesk_Download/ I do not think the PNY is deffective, otherwise my BIOS would not detect it, and it would also not pass the BIOS' NVME controller tests.

Also the answer other questions: no it does show up in diskpart, it is like the disk is completely invisible to the OS - but shows in the BIOS. But I managed to fix the problem. In short: I had to reinstall Windows 10 and did this with both the nvme drives installed on the motherboard. Unlike some other posts I've read here and elsewhere about the Windows setup only seeing one drive at a time. Somehow for me this was not an issue with both installed but I guess this really depends on your choice of motherboard manufacturer and chipset type. Going in a bit more detail, I can't really understand why an installed Windows OS was not able to detect and use an additionally placed nvme drive, as opposed to the Windows setup. I spend a lot of time checking and playing with different BIOS settings, removing additional components (an additional RAID0 array, USB devices, etc.) but in the end nothing really helped - until my last option was to reinstall. Just one additional note: I had a small issue during the Windows setup that was not related to my nvme topic. For some reason the setup process was always \"stuck\" on 11% at the \"Preparing files.. \" section (something like that). I had to really disconnect all external equipment again and finally figured out this was due to my wireless Logitech mouse that uses a USB receiver. So hopping through the setup using a keyboard only did the trick (although if you have a spare wired USB mouse lying around that would likely work as well). Again, your mileage may vary depending on your chosen hardware, but I can say that the above worked in my case."

Both are 1 TB drives and I'm using Macrium Reflect but am getting the error \"clone failed - write failed - 22 - invalid argument.\" I'm following these 2 guides as I go http://www.howtogeek.com/97242/how-to-migrate-windows-7-to-a-solid-state-drive/ and http://www.howtogeek.com/199068/how-to-upgrade-your-existing-hard-drive-in-under-an-hour/.

            "Jasjar----Try formatting the destination drive first",
            "ArtPog----It's hard to tell what went awry with the Macrium disk-cloning operation since a variety of factors can be involved, including user error in utilizing the program. Presumably you've attempted at least another d-c operation with the program, but with the same failed results, right? Nearly needless to say it's absolutely essential that both the source &amp; destination disks are non-defective. You didn't indicate the make of the SSD disk that's intended to serve as the destination disk for the clone. Many, if not most, SSD manufacturers include a \"data-migration\" program with their models, e.g., Samsung's Data Migration program. So use one of those if appropriate. If Jasjar's suggestion (a good one) doesn't resolve the problem with the Macrium program, you might want to try a disk-cloning program that I use nearly exclusively. (I use the program chiefly as a comprehensive backup program that I employ routinely for that purpose). It's the Casper program - commercially available for $49.99. However Casper has a 30-day trial version that you might want to try. Here are instructions for using the program in case you're interested... 1. Download/install the Casper Trial Edition v8 disk-cloning program from https://www.fssdev.com/products/casper/trial/ 2. Before undertaking the disk-cloning operation close all open programs. (Generally you need not disable your anti-virus program). Ensure your destination drive - the proposed recipient of the clone - is properly connected in the system and ideally no other disks but the source &amp; destination ones are connected in the system. 3. Double-click on the Casper 8.0 icon to open the program. 4. Click \"Choose other options\", then \"Copy Drive\" on the following window. 5. On the next window click \"Perform a different copy\". 6. The next window will list the drives connected in your system. The source (C:\\) drive (the drive you will be cloning) will be highlighted. The System Reserved partition will be cloned to the destination disk as well. Click Next. 7. The next window will list your proposed destination disk - the recipient of the clone. If you have more than one potential destination disk currently connected in your system they will be listed as well. Ensure the disk you want to serve as the destination disk is highlighted. Click Next. 8. If the destination disk contains data the next window will indicate a warning that this data will be lost as a result of the disk-cloning operation. Click Next. 9. The next window gives the user an option to assign a name to the destination disk for future Casper disk-cloning operations involving that disk. If no name is desired uncheck the box. Click Next. 10. The next window reflects how the cloned data will be distributed on the destination disk. The default proportionate distribution option will suffice in nearly every case. Click Next. 11. A message may appear indicating that this Casper Trial Edition does not support \"volume resizing\" - basically user manipulation of partitions on the destination disk. This feature is available on the Casper commercial version. Click Continue. 12. On the final user screen click \"Perform the copy now\". 13. Exit from the program after receiving message that the disk-cloning operation was successful. Good luck whatever method you choose to use.",

This sounds more like a BIOS issue rather than an HDD issue (it shouldn't affect the BIOS this way), however just to be on the safe side, I'd recommend that you try the drive with a different SATA cable and port or a different computer, to see if the same thing happens. You could also try testing the drive with DLG (Data Lifeguard Diagnostics) by running both tests (Quick and Extended), to see if there's anything wrong with it. Here's how to do that How to test a drive for problems using Data Lifeguard Diagnostics for Windows.\nIn the ideal case, it would be awesome if you can test another HDD with this computer to see if that happens again, so that you could isolate the issue and see if it's HDD or BIOS related.\nAlso, don't forget to try what @bjsm's advice as well. Other than that, you could try updating/resetting the BIOS, to see if that helps you resolve the issue. edit: Sorry I just saw your response, after I've posted mine. Hope that helps. Please let me know how everything goes.\nBoogieman_WD",

            "radR----I have Intel 330 120GB and while it has rarely acted up (BIOS fails to recognize it once every few months, leading to cable fiddling), it started showing some real trouble yesterday. The system wouldn't boot (displaying a black screen without any bios messages) and restart eventually, or if it did load Windows, it would hard freeze soon after boot up. Windows would not respond to any input and would require a hard restart. This would continue until I disconnected the data cable from the SSD (but keep the power cable), start the system for ~30 minutes, plug the data cable back on and restart the computer. At this point it would boot and work normally until the next shut down. After doing the same thing today, everything seemed fine until I tried to load Dota 2, at which point the system froze again and required a hard restart. Had to unplug/let it run/plug the cable back in and same thing happened when I tried to launch Just Cause 2. To fix this, I decided to reinstall the graphics drivers. I uninstalled and installed the latest AMD Catalyst, but it failed due to some errors. Somewhere during a few reboots and attempts to uninstall/install the drivers, the system effectively shit itself and does not detect any graphics drivers at all, now refusing to boot even after doing the ssd unplug/plug trick. When loading Windows, at one point it shows BSoD for a split second and restarts itself. I can now only boot Windows in safe mode. Back when it was working, Intel SSD toolbox showed no errors.

            "JohnnyLucky----NGFF = Next Generation Form Factor - This is a general term that was used when M.2 PCIe ssd's were first introduced. It is rarely used anymore. It just meant the new ssd's were a lot smaller than the standard 2.5 inch ssd's. AHCI = Advance Host Controller Interface - The process used by software and motherboard memory to communicate with SATA devices. It was originally developed to improve hard disk drive performance and is enabled in a motherboard's system BIOS. NVMe = Non-Volatile Memory Express - The longer term is Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface Specification (NVMHCI). This newer interface is designed for use with M.2 PCIe ssd's that are connected via a PCIe header/port instead of a SATA connection. The use of multiple PCIe channels improves ssd performance. M.2 and PCIe ssd's are both PCIe ssd's. The difference between the two is the way in which they are connected to a motherboard. PCIe ssd's are mounted on a PCIe adapter card which is inserted in an appropriate PCIe slot on a motherboard just like a graphics card or a sound card. M.2 ssd's are not mounted on a PCIe adapter card. Instead, M.2 ssd's are inserted into a small M.2 header/port on a motherboard. The M.2 version is the most popular because it is ideal for small mobile computers. A few ssd companies offer the M.2 models with or without a PCIe adapter card. If it is plugged into an M.2 slot, then it is commonly referred to as an M.2 ssd. If the same ssd is mounted on a PCIe adapter card, then it is commonly referred to as a PCIe ssd. M.2 SATA 3 - Older M.2 version whose performance was equal to standard 2.5 inch SATA 3 6Gb/s ssd's. Still available. mSATA - The original small form factor ssd. Quickly replaced by M.2. Still available for older computers. Your motherboard has the following headers/ports for ssd's: 1 PCIe 3.0 x 16 slot. Normally used for a graphics card so it really is not suitable for an ssd. 1 x PCIe 3.0 x 16 slot running at PCIe 16.0 x 4. Suitable for a PCIe 3.0 x 4 or PCIe 3.0 x 2 ssd mounted on an adapter card. 1 M.2 3.0 x 4 header/port. In addition to an M.2 3.0 x 4 ssd, this header is also backward compatible with M.2 3.0 x 2 ssd's and M.2 SATA 3 6Gb/s ssd's. If an M.2 SATA 3 6Gb/s ssd is used, then SATA header/port #01 is disabled. 6 SATA 3 headers/ports for standard 2.5 inch SATA 3 6Gb/s ssd's. The headers are also backward compatible with older SATA 2 3Gb/s ssd's. Based on how you use your computer, I recommend either a standard 2.5 inch SATA 3 6Gb/s ssd or an M.2 SATA 3 6Gb/s ssd. The Samsung 850 EVO would be a good choice. It is available in both M.2 SATA 3 and standard 2.5 inch SATA 3 formats. They perform well and have a proven track record. You'll have to check prices for both models. I maintain an ssd database that is listed in a sticky at the very top of this forum section. Here is the link: http://www.johnnylucky.org/data-storage/ssd-database.html You'll see the different ssd categories. Scroll down to the categories and models you are interested in and follow the links to the technical reviews.

            "gtr0----Hello. I have an HP Z420 Workstation that came with the HP LSI SAS PCIe card. Since I do audio (Pro Tools) I thought it may be a cool idea to grab a few SAS 15k drives. So I ordered a few Hitachi HUS156060VLS600 drives. 600 GB 15k drives. The confusing part is, never having tried anything scsi based with exception of a zip drive some decades ago, I am confused by the choices of cables to get for this. I only quickly looked but the card looks like it has SATA type connectors. The drives seem to look similar to SATA, but I have not received them yet, so I am unsure - seems like they are not keyed exactly like a SATA and may take one of those connectors that have power and data in the same cable. Though it sounds like I have answered my own question I am riddled with doubt as to what I should be buying. Could anyone offer advise here? Thank you!",
            "JaredDM----SATA and SAS use pretty much the same physical connection. SAS actually stands for \"Serial attached SCSI\". However, SATA and SAS speak different languages. SATA uses the ATA command set while SAS uses SCSI commands. What you need to know is this: SATA drives can work on a SAS controller but SAS drives WILL NOT WORK on a SATA controller. So if you're planning on plugging those drives into a consumer grade motherboard, it's not going to work....period. Yes, I know they sell adapters, but those are for different purposes. You'll notice that there's an extra little bridge with some extra pins between where the power and SATA cables normally would plug in on a SATA drive. This prevents plugging a SAS drive into a SATA backplane while still allowing a SATA drive to fit into an SAS backplane. So if you want to use those drives you'll need to purchase an bonafide SAS controller card.",
            "gtr0----Thanks for the reply. Yes, as I said the HP Z Worstation did come with a SAS controller card - actually there is also an integrated controller in the mobo, but 1st gen, so 3Gb/s. The controller card is an 8x HP LSI 9212-4i so it is 4 port 6Gb/s. I have done my homework as best as I could. I am just confused a bit for the cabling, but I am slowly arriving to the conclusion of what I need. And I received the drives today, they are HGST 15k 6Gb/s SAS drives like this. The controller is an LSI 9212-4i like this. And I think I need this cable, 18in SAS 29 Pin to SATA Cable with LP4 Power Is this the correct assessment? Thank you!",

            "SuperSoph_WD----Hello there again, @thisispas! If your hard drive is not spinning up in multiple computers, you are most probably dealing with a failed HDD. If you have any important data on it that you wish to recover, I'd strongly recommend you turn to a professional data recovery company for assistance. They would be your best bet on getting any of the files back. Tampering with the HDD physically by yourself is not recommended. The hardware inside is pretty sensitive and it requires you to have the technical knowledge and a specific dust-free lab environment to operate. Moreover, it's still hard to determine what part of the HDD might have failed. :/ I'd advise you to check your warranty (even though 320 GB models are not manufactured anymore) and see, if by any chance, it's still covered. If it's not, I'd suggest you simply replace the failed drive with a new one. You will avoid a lot of headaches. Even if you do manage to get the HDD working again, I'd definitely not trust it with any important data. Good luck!\nSuperSoph_WD",
            "thisispas----@SuperSoph_WD omg...i'd recover my data as soon as possible as its very impn..thereafter i'd see if it gets repaired or not. am glad for a precious help from you.... Thank you once again!.",

Check some of WD's Worldwide data recovery partners from the hyperlink in my previous post and find the one closest to you. Best of luck! I hope I was helpful. SuperSoph_WD",

            "stanza----Hi all, First post here. I have a Windows XP SP3 desktop machine.\nI have recently purchased a Western Digital WD20EARS 2 TB SATA hard drive a few months ago. I connected it through one of the SATA cables and everything was working fine.\nOne day, the hard drive failed and windows was not able to detect it in My Computer. In the Disk Manager it said '931GB Unallocated' In order to recover my data I then proceeded to remove it from my system, fit it into an enclose and then connect it via USB to my new ASUS laptop running Windows 7. When I plugged it in it said that I needed to format the drive.\nI used a software called Recovery Pro to retrieve all data on my drive. Fortunately I was able to recover all my data and save it to one of the drives on my laptop. Apparently my partition table was screwed. After that was done I then connected it back to my desktop and now my BIOS only detects that drive as I TB. Have a look at the screens below: { \"lightbox_close\": \"Close\", \"lightbox_next\": \"Next\", \"lightbox_previous\": \"Previous\", \"lightbox_error\": \"The requested content cannot be loaded. Please try again later.\", \"lightbox_start_slideshow\": \"Start slideshow\", \"lightbox_stop_slideshow\": \"Stop slideshow\", \"lightbox_full_screen\": \"Full screen\", \"lightbox_thumbnails\": \"Thumbnails\", \"lightbox_download\": \"Download\", \"lightbox_share\": \"Share\", \"lightbox_zoom\": \"Zoom\", \"lightbox_new_window\": \"New window\", \"lightbox_toggle_sidebar\": \"Toggle sidebar\" } In Disk Manager when I tried to format it only recognises it as 1 TB. So I decided to go ahead and format it as NTFS. Right now I have a newly formatted drive with only 1 TB. I have no idea why this happened. When I first started off the system was able to detect it as a 2 TB drive. It seems like after my hard drive crash a TB of space has gone AWOL. Is this something I need to Western Digital about getting a replacement since this drive is under warranty? I have a look around the wen and I found this post: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/255691-32-bought-drive-bios-detect Looks like I'm not alone ? Thanks, any help would be appreciated. Stanley ",

            "hoorhay----Title is vague sorry. I have a custom built tower that I neglected originally to put an SSD in. I'm now purchasing one, and I'm curious which method would be the easiest to switch my data/partition over from my HDD to SSD. I figured I could just dock the SSD and connect it to my tower when it arrives, use macrium reflect to clone the HDD to the SSD. When done undock the SSD put it in the tower, swap the mobo sata connections around so the SSD is the boot drive, wipe then reallocate the HDD when I see the SSD cloned successfully. Then use the HDD as data storage etc. Is my thinking correct on this? Am I neglecting to think of something?",
            "USAFRet----2 ways forward - clone from the HDD to the SSD, or clean install ont he SSD 1. Clone/migration - This requires that the total used space on the current C partition to be significantly smaller than the new SSD. Also, how old is that install, and does it currently work to your satisfaction?\nThere are multiple tools that can do this.\nThis usually works. 2. Clean install - This requires that you have a valid license key and the install media for th OS&lt; and all of your other applications.\nThis always works.",
            "hoorhay----Good points! The SSD is an 850 EVO 250GB. I'm presently using 189GB of a 1TB HDD. So I believe I'd definitely clear the current size constraints. I'd just uninstall some less desired apps/data that don't need SSD priority in terms of performance etc. The current install has been working very well for me. Clean install would be fine, but I think it'd ultimately be more work for me as I'd have to reinstall a lot of different apps/games. I'd also have to reinstall windows 8.1 then upgrade to windows 10 again? Or is it possible to simply just reinstall 10?",
            "cosmoji----yeah macrium will work, but i think you're making this very complicated. first, switching the cables is not going to change what drive it boots off of. the system knows what is what by hardware id. you need to go in to bios and change the boot order. i suggest this. when it arrives, install it in the system. turn your pc on and clone the hdd to the ssd. when its finished, shut the pc off. turn it back on and go in to your bios(probably repeatedly pressing delete or f11 keys as it boots) and find the option to change the boot order or sequence. move the ssd to the top of the list. save and exit the bios. it will now boot off the ssd. now you can delete the partition off the hdd to use it as storage, or keep it as a backup. now as usafret said, the sdd has to be quite a bit larger than the amount of data being cloned to it, just to be safe. if the clone seems broken, just boot back to the hdd, and try again. sometimes things go wrong. dont worry, nothings lost since you still have the original on the hdd, just do the clone over. you could also just use bootable media to do a clean install too, then transfer over what files you want to keep. but you will have to reinstall everything you want to keep from the original drive. if you have the time to put in to this, it is really what's best. clones might be imperfect, or your original drive might be a little messy to begin with. but many people try to avoid it as its work to reinstall everything and get it back the way you like it. as long as your windows 10 is verified, you can create bootable media for 10 and install right to it. they dont use keys anymore for that, if your current 10 install is verified, your hardware will be recognized when you try to verify the new install.",
            "USAFRet---- So...\nTry the migration from old HDD to new SSD. You are close, but not over, the space requirements.\nIf, for whatever reason, it does not work, your fallback option is clean install on the SSD."

            "dan_seven----Hello everyone, once again I appreciate all the help I received before from here. This time I have a fairly huge concern about my netbook 2.5 sata HDD, is a Seagate Momentus SpinPoint M8 (AFT) (# model - ST500LM012 HN-M500MBB). A week ago I started to have some troubles because my netbook would randomly restart and then the message that there wasn't any booting device appeared and the BIOS won't detect the HDD, but after turning it off and on, everything was fine again. I took it to a repair station and it turns out, some of the capacitors near the HDD sata slot were faulty so they replaced them. I decided to connect the HDD to my desktop PC and check first the drive before backup-format. I used HDtune, Crystal Disk Info and GSmart Control. HD Tune didn't gave me anything \"anormal\" in the Health section, but when I ran an Error Scan, the results where 0.6% of damaged blocks. Then I ran Crystal Disk and it gave me a warning for the current pending sector count (Raw value=48), and finally GSmart said the exact same thing about pending sectors and the exact same raw value, a self-short test rapidly gave me this: I'm really sorry but I don't have any log or screenshot of the other 2 programs. I freaked out and I decided to back up everything I could (which was everything I had, I didn't had any single problems during the copy of my files or anything at all), and then I used a Win7 bootable USB and through Command Prompt cleaned and formatted (long, not quick) the HDD with Diskpart. I connected again the HDD to my PC, and every single warning was gone. These are some screenshots: HD Tune { \"lightbox_close\": \"Close\", \"lightbox_next\": \"Next\", \"lightbox_previous\": \"Previous\", \"lightbox_error\": \"The requested content cannot be loaded. Please try again later.\", \"lightbox_start_slideshow\": \"Start slideshow\", \"lightbox_stop_slideshow\": \"Stop slideshow\", \"lightbox_full_screen\": \"Full screen\", \"lightbox_thumbnails\": \"Thumbnails\", \"lightbox_download\": \"Download\", \"lightbox_share\": \"Share\", \"lightbox_zoom\": \"Zoom\", \"lightbox_new_window\": \"New window\", \"lightbox_toggle_sidebar\": \"Toggle sidebar\" } Crystal Disk Here is the GSmart Control log: ST500LM012_HN-M500MBB_S2TDJA0C191847_2013-11-30.txt\nAs you can see, the self test log still has the previous entries (the ones I posted before), but now it includes the successful short test after the cleaning and formatting: After these re-tests I'm more confused. I read several other threads with the same \"Current Pending Sector Count warning\" and they ranged from several solutions from: \"Throw your HDD to the trash now!\", to \"I think you are safe if you don't see any more damaged blocks coming up\", and my question is, should I keep using this HDD now that is clean and \"free from warnings\"?, should I just throw it away?, should I install my Win 7 again? (Win7 x64 Ultimate by the way). Any more info needed or any questions or advice are very welcomed.",
            "Phillip Corcoran----You were right to back up your data, but you should have been doing that all along anyway since a hard drive can fail without warning at any time, even where no prior warnings are given. Whatever the ins and outs of your tests mean, one thing is certain. The drive is at best unreliable, at worst due to fail any day. Get it replaced, and please don't treat backing up data as something you do only when warnings appear.",
            "dan_seven---- You're right Philip, thanks for your fast reply. I should back-up more often, although my point was that I didn't had any problems copying files, I thought that based on the diagnostics I wouldn't be able to recover any data at all. I was even able to install my previous Win 7 x64 Ultimate with a clean boot, and is running fine, but when I tried to restore an image I did of the same system in a same clean boot + the official drivers from the manufacturer website (Acer) and with some programs like antivirus, office and up-to-that-date Windows updates to avoid the need of having to re-install all that, it gave me a BSOD with the Error Stop 0x7B . Should I consider to just re-install my Win 7 and start from 0?, right now I'm not able to replace this HDD just like that. All this sounds to me almost like a false alert. I had a faulty HDD one time, and it gave me like 50% of bad blocks the first test, and the health based on HDtune was horrible, I did this same thing of cleaning with Diskpart and after that the status was exactly the same, nothing changed so of course I had it RMA.",

            "dan_seven----\nThanks fzabkar, I think that's exactly what happened because I already have used this noetbook for a couple of days withouth any single fail, error, issue or problem at all. I have already installed all my software, have stored all my backups and the HDD is as good as new, I guess it was just a matter of maintenance?, anyway, thanks for the clarification."

            "velocityg4----NAS or Enterprise drives can be better. They can have better vibration resistance and produce lower temps. The biggest difference is they use TLER (Time limited error recovery). If the drive has a bad sector it will hammer on it trying to retrieve data before remapping the sector. With TLER this time is limited to about 7 seconds. Which will handle most bad sectors. While a desktop drive may spend thirty seconds to a minute trying to recover the bad sector. For the most part if 7 seconds isn't enough time. More time won't make a difference. But in a few rare circumstances that extra time spent may actually recover that piece of data. As long as you keep a backup this isn't an issue. If you don't keep a backup. A fool and his data will soon be parted. As far as noise. Seagate seems to be the quietest for 10TB. They are even quieter than 8TB drives in active use.\nhttps://us.hardware.info/reviews/6975/14/22-6-10tb-hard-drives-review-one-drive-a-lot-of-storage-noise-levels As for 5 years of reliability. The helium drives are quite different than older lower capacity drives. So things may have changed. HGST (Hitachi) has been the most reliable in the past. Although looking at 8TB Seagates. It seems that Seagate has greatly improved their reliability. I guess those lawsuits and bad PR hurt them.\nhttps://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-benchmark-stats-2016/\nhttps://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/seagate As for personal preference. I would buy whichever is cheaper. It won't really make a difference in a non RAID scenario. Every manufacturer can have a bad line. As long as they correct the problem in future lines. I have eight Samsung drives right now. Four bought in 2009 (1TB), two in 2013 (4TB) and two in 2014 (5TB). All of them still function properly. Although personal experience is not statistically relevant. In the past ten years I have had five or six WD hard drives fail. About 50% failure rates. I have had no Hitachi drives fail and I have had one Seagate fail. Although I think only one failure has ever been within the first three years. It was the Seagate in the first month or two and was replaced by Seagate. The only reason the WDs had such a high failure rate is they have many more years on them.

            "christymoceri----Hi, I know nothing about computer hardware. But my Alienware has been getting a ''SMART status failed, backup and replace'' message on bootup which indicates hard drive failure is imminent. I love my machine, so I figured I might as well upgrade to a 1TB Samsung EVO SSD. Since I'm going for a full replacement, I think it's as simple as using a 2.5'' adapter carriage in the original HDD slot. Is that right? Assuming that's the case, where does that fit with cloning the hard drive to transfer it to the new SSD? My hard drive hasn't failed yet, so I should be able to transfer the Windows 10 data still. Most guides I have seen (like this one: https://www.howtogeek.com/97242/how-to-migrate-windows-7-to-a-solid-state-drive/) say the SSD can be installed ''alongside'' the HDD for transfer, but that's typically when adding the SSD as additional storage, not using it to replace the HDD altogether. Is there a way to temporarily use that process to install an SSD alongside the HDD, transfer the data to the new drive using something like EaseUS ToDo Backup, and then replace the HDD altogether? Or is that too convoluted? Should I just install it alongside and leave it there, even though the old drive is bad? I bought all the cables required for that as well. Maybe I should just cut my losses, simply replace the drive, and do a clean Windows Install. Either way, I'm pretty far out of my element. Thanks for your input. -Christy",
            "ArtPog----1. Hopefully the OS on your present boot HDD that's failing hasn't been corrupted as a consequence of the mechanical/electronic failing of that drive. 2. Presumably (although you didn't say) the system boots &amp; properly functions other than the \"failing\" message you've received. 3. That being the case it's important that you do comprehensively back up the system A/S/A/P. (You should have been routinely doing this even when your system was working without problems. It's incumbant upon a user to create &amp; maintain comprehensive backups of one's system from time-to-time so that in the event of disaster striking, the user has the means to return the system to a bootable functional one. So keep that in mind.) 4. So give the disk-cloning operation a shot. (I assume the 1 TB SSD you plan to purchase will be large enough to contain the total contents of your present HDD.) Should things not work out as a result of the disk-cloning operation, you can always fresh-install the Win 10 OS onto the SSD. 5. The EaseUS Todo program is used by many PC users. It should do the trick. 6. Remember - THIS IS IMPORTANT - that following the d-c operation disconnect the HDD from the system and with the newly-cloned SSD as the ONLY drive in the system boot to it and determine all is well and the system properly functions. ONLY THEN should you return the HDD to the system where it will function as a secondary drive. 7. Of course if the HDD is failing - it should be checked out by a HDD diagnostic program - possibly one from the drive's manufacturer (they're generally available) or another diagnostic program and it's confirmed the drive IS failing, then it should not be installed in the PC. Rather, discarded.",
            "christymoceri----Thank you! Yes, the system currently boots and functions without a problem. I'm hoping to replace it before it fails. The OS has been acting a little wonky, particularly when I run games, but I can't say for sure that's related to hard drive issues as I've never experienced them before. Certainly, the machine is running more slowly. I'm backing up the system now. I'm terrible about doing that regularly, but I also don't store important documents on my PC. I use it primarily for gaming and to run my remote desktop for work. I almost exclusively use Dropbox to store important files and I semi-regularly back up my super important Dropbox documents (like drafts of my novels) onto a flash drive. This is why I'm wondering if it would make more sense just to do a clean install of Windows 10 and forget about cloning. Before I replace the hard drive I'm going to create a Windows system restore disk. After I have everything functioning properly I think I'm going to invest in something like BackBlaze to regularly back up my hard drive AND Dropbox files automatically. It's a little redundant but when it comes to my writing I'm a bit paranoid. I can't replace 1,000 hours of labor. The only PC data I'm really worried about losing is my gaming data (Skyrim and Diablo III mostly), but I'm pretty sure Steam saves all my progress. So maybe I'm making this more complicated than it has to be. 1 TB should be plenty of space. Probably too much. Question about 6. You make it sound like I should be keeping the HDD connected as a secondary drive even though it's failing. Wouldn't it make more sense to just replace the whole thing and install the SDD in its place? I bought a 2.5'' adapter carriage to do that. Is there any real advantage to leaving a bad drive connected? Thanks very much for your time. ",
            "christymoceri----You answered my question with your edit! I did confirm via Alienware's diagnostic program that the drive is failing. I will discard it.\n",
            "ArtPog----Well it sounds like you're certainly on the right track re your proposed backup strategy. The crucial element is to select such that meets your specific needs. We utilize a disk-cloning program (not EaseUS) to routinely comprehensively backup our systems, so for all practical purposes we have a bit-for-bit copy of the drive we have cloned. (We prefer our backups \"at home\" so to speak - our choice). We employ the disk-cloning program both on a automatic scheduled basis (e.g., 3 AM each day) as well as a manual basis when circumstances dictate. The important, nay crucial thing, is that a PC user employ whatever backup strategy meets his/her needs so that when disaster does strike in the form of a failed boot (or other) drive or the system's OS becomes so corrupt as a result of malware, misconfiguration, or any other reason, the user has the means at hand to easily and relatively quickly return their system to a bootable functional state,"

Then, I bought a second HDD caddy and put that hard drive into it and plug in to the DVD ROM port by replacing the DVD RW.\nIt was working fine. Because I did this to my previous laptop too. But, I got a problem with this new laptop. After about 1 day, It started to generate a clicking sound from the hard disk. It was about one clicking sound per 3 minutes. Actually I didn't know why is that so I use it about 1 day. Since the clicking sound continued, I decided to check it. After I removed the caddy, I realized that when I put the Hard Drive into the caddy and slide it inside, the breathing hole of the hard drive get covered. Then I though because of that I got the problem of clicking sound. now, even If I connect the hard drive to the original position, or via USB, it gives that clicking sound even when the breathing hole is not covered. Is there some way to fix it without damaging to the hard drive? Thanks for you help.",

I'd strongly recommend you to back up any important data from it ASAP. I'm not sure you'd be able to get an RMA from your original laptop manufacturer because you've opened the computer itself and replaced the DVD-RW, but you should definitely consider buying a replacement HDD. Hope I was helpful. Good luck!\nSuperSoph_WD",

            "ahthurungnone----Everyone with Windows 7 has utilized the \"Windows Experience Rating\" to see how their system rates and which components are the culprits of overall system speed. There are obviously better applications which can provide a more accurate rating, but let's just stay with the Win Exp Rating for now since this is what most consumers will use. When I run the Win Exp test on my desktop (note the hardware below), my lowest rating is now my hard drive. The processor, gpu, mobo, memory, etc all test above 6.0 and some over 7.0. However, my SATA Barracuda 7200RPM 1TB hard drive only shows a rating of 5.9 (the same rating before I upgraded the cpu, mobo, and memory). If I added another drive with RAID so that the data was divided between 2 drives thereby increasing the speed at which data arrives at the cpu, what amount of gain would I see? If I abandoned mechanical drives all together and utilized a SSD, what would be the resulting performance increase? (I do imagine a time when mechanical drives, and drives in general, will be like 5-1/4 floppies. There will be a time when data will simply be found \"in-the-air\" and our computers (our whatever we call them then) will wirelessly \"grab\" that data and use it. One day we won't have any \"drives\" or data stored physically. But that's another discussion.)",

Another thing you could try is connecting the pen drive to another computer and see how it will get recognized there. Always remember that \"backup\" means that you have your data stored in at least two (2) locations. Moving data from your system drive to an external hard drive is not a backup, unless there is already a duplicate of the file on a different drive. Keep me posted! Hope it helps! SuperSoph_WD",

Sadly, it's also possible that the flash drive is failing, so it might be a good idea to consider professional data recovery help, if the files on it are very important to you.

While this is probably the last thing I'll upgrade, what I'm considering is getting a solid state HD pretty much strictly for Win 7. What I don't know is if this is really worthwhile. I realise it will help with boot times but then I figure there's a lot of other windows related stuff that needs to be loaded up. I also mostly use my computer for gaming so then there's another possible issue. And finally, all the little apps and whatnot - media players, game launching apps like Steam, audio devices etc. I'm just not sure what would benefit most from being on the SSHD. The prices are quite high compared to normal HDDs so I'd want to keep it to a minimum. I guess my question is really just concerning segregation of files - what should go where and how much extra space is recommended for future service packs and that sort of thing? I generally have it in mind to put all games and 3rd party stuff on my current HDD and restrict the SSHD to Win 7, maybe Norton Antivirus. Do any programs mess up or run poorly if they're on a separate HD from Windows? Sorry for the somewhat convoluted paragraph, I'm just a bit inexperienced in this stuff. Thanks for any help ",

It's like reading through a book that uses the standard chapter/page/paragraph format, versus a book that omits the chapter separators. It's still a single book, &amp; you still have to flip through it to find the page you're looking for. Chapters can help you organize it more effectively, but they don't help you read it any faster. Mainly, what it's going to do is allow you to better organize your files &amp; apps on the hard drive. Setting up 2 partitions helps you track better what's taking up your storage space, &amp; gives you a better handle on when you might need to add more storage in the future. If you're looking to improve your performance, you'd be better off adding a 2nd drive. Even if you don't go for the standard primary SSD/secondary HDD combo, a 2nd HDD gives you an opportunity to put your apps &amp; other regularly-accessed files onto the faster drive, while keeping your main data files on the slower drive. I did that before I went SSD -- used a WD Blue for my apps &amp; main files, &amp; a WD Green (slower, low-power drive) for my secondary files/backup/\"other\" files. Now, I have a 3-drive system: SSD for OS &amp; certain apps, WD Black (\"faster\" drive) for the majority of my apps &amp; primary data files (music, pictures, etc.), &amp; WD Blue (\"regular\" drive) for my backups &amp; secondary files."

I thought about changing the role of main drive to the other one but I don't really know how to do it. Windows pops up some errors, I got no clue.. SO, what I think I can only do right now is replacing the whole C hard drive. Is that the best option in that case? If so - is it even safe to my C drive?\nI have a lot of important data there so I wonder if everyting will be the same after plugging it back in.. ?\nWill the connections between drives like shortcuts, files related to different drives and other things like that stay the same?

According to the cloning software, having multiple OS's on the source disk might make the disk work incorrectly. I am not sure how, but I have both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on the source disk and I need to remove Windows 7 to make it work properly. What I'm think is that I can try to back up my programs and personal files onto a borrowed external drive. I can then do a Factor Restore, and this should mean I just have windows 8.1? If anyone can alert me of any pitfalls or confirm if this would work, I would much appreciate it. I won't be going ahead with it until I'm certain.",
            "ArtPog----I take it you're solely interested in using the Win 8.1 OS and not interested in a Win 7 OS, so I'll proceed on that basis, OK? Most (but not all) disk-cloning programs have the capability of cloning individual partitions from a source disk to a destination disk. The Macrium Reflect Free program is an example. So you could clone the partition containing the Win 8.1 OS to your new SSD. We're assuming in this scenario that your present 8.1 OS boots &amp; functions without problems. And that the disk size of the SSD is sufficient to contain the total data contents residing in that 8.1 partition. If the preceding is not the case then you can stop right now. Now if there are programs and other data on your Win 7 OS that you want on your new installation you could copy all that data over to the SSD following a successful cloning of your 8.1 OS. Naturally once again the SSD size would need to be sufficient for this additional data. You would, of course, need to reinstall the programs from your Win 7 system once the transfer of data has been accomplished.",

Some people love the samsung software (It is useful to select which files you want to transfer over) but for 1:1 cloning other software is better. install the macrium reflect to any one of the OS's and then connect the SSD either though a SATA or USB adapter and then clone your existing drive to the SSD. onces done just set the SSD as the primary boot and you should be good to go."

U can verify this by having the network monitor tool open and u can see in real time what is coming down and what is going back up.

I looked a the drive on my machine, the file system looks right. I always assumed that installing an SSD was about the same as installing a normal HDD. But I've never downgraded from a RAID to a single drive. Please, if anyone has any ideas on this it would mean a lot to me.

If there are not any then you know where a majority of it has gone, its been deleted. if there are you can restore to a point just a few days ago and look on C with a disk analyzer and see whats taking so much space. Then you can choose to remove it or leave it. If c is your desktop aswell you may have had an extremely full recycle bin. Its never fully emtied until you empty it.

When you install the new 256 GB SSD you will have to do a clean install on the drive, with the HDD disconnected (otherwise the system will see the old OS and boot from it). After installation of the SSD you will reconnect the HDD and wipe out the cloned 128 GB partition and stretch the HDD back to its original size. If I were you I wouldn't do this but, would create a restore file of the C: drive on the HDD, and wait for the delivery of the new SSD. When the new SSD came I'd use the restore function of Windows to recreate the original OS disk on the 256 GB SSD. If need be, I'd use Partition Wizard to stretch the 256 SSd to its full capacity.

A bad diode will read 0 or near 0 ohms in both directions. If either one is blown, you can likely just remove it and it'll work long enough to copy out the data.

(If I could find the right chip) Any place that you know of where I can send the PCB to who will flip out the bad diode and install a good one, then I'll have a good working drive (as good as ever anyway) with protection still in it.

        "usercomment": [
            "Mic_n----Been a while since I've built much, currently running an old socket 1366 i7 from before Intel started using their caching stuff. Anyway, I'm using a separate (128GB) SSD as a system drive in my current system, and runing over my options for a possible 'next build'.. I'm well and truly over having to manually manage installs between physical drives and caching sounds like a great solution.. benchmarks I've seen suggest that serving cached content is \"very nearly\" as fast as a dedicated SSD, without the headache. However, I'm wondering.. All the documentation I've seen says Intel's in-firmware solution is limited to 64GB. Is that still the case? With growing software install sizes and falling storage prices, I'm thinking that figure is a bit low, and having a larger persistant cache can only be a good thing? Is it possible to dedicate a larger chunk of drive to cache? Also wondering about the possibility of running multiple drives in a RAID-0 config to serve as the cache (potentially in front of another RAID 1 or 5 array?) I'm thinking that's possibly getting a little beyond what Intel's firmware solution can provide though.. I've seen reference to VeloSSD as a possibility, wondering if there's anything else out there people could recommend? Also also, wondering about interface bandwidth in such a setup.. At what sort of point would I need to start being concerned of saturating a SATA 6GB bus?\n",
            "Traciatim----I guess the better question is, how much of an actual improvement will you experience on your machine with this unique setup over just a large SSD? I mean, if you open firefox faster than you can move your hand from your mouse to your keyboard to type the URL you want then at what point do you just not care if it's faster? As an example, my Laptop for work has a 16GB partition as a cache to it's spinning disk and usually well over 50% of the reads on the drive are read from cache, depending on the day and what I use it's upwards of 80%. A caching RAID controller with a large amount of RAM or a huge SSD cache will already cost you about a grand, but a 1TB SSD will be something like 5 or 6 hundred bucks. So how much faster do you really need it?",
            "Mic_n----Fair call.. I keep forgetting that SSDs have that internal parallelism thing going on and bigger tends to equal more faster anyway. I guess the crux of what I'm looking for is... software installs keep getting bigger (This will, amongst other things, be getting used for gaming, where 50GB+ installs seem to be getting more and more standard).. meantime SSD prices are coming down. 64GB just seems quite constrained, when I could for very little extra cost drop a considerably larger drive in there and theoretically have much more content being held in cache. Intel's SRT thing is still limited to that though, isn't it? Has there been any news on them lifting that by any chance?",
            "Traciatim---- I'm not sure if there is even a need. If 64GB of your most commonly accessed stuff is at SSD speed then that's a huge portion of your seeks to things like your MFT and windows files, and your most used applications will all be in the cache. If you think of a Windows 7 directory. If I look at mine currently it's 23.7GB, but how much of that is really read more than 10 times a day? Maybe 2-5% of it... possibly up to 10% of it? 4.8GB of mine is just the installer directory... why would that ever need to be on an SDD? So instead of making a manual link and moving that data to a spinning disk you can run the SSD as a cache disk and only the most accessed things will be fast. So if you took something like a 256GB SSD, and 4 2TB spinning disks in a RAID5 you could have 64GB of the SSD as a cache to the spinning disk volume, and 190GB for installing anything you really want to always be on the SSD like your browser and 4-5 of your favorite games. You'd end up with a 6TB machine that boots quick and feels snappy, but doesn't cost thousands of dollars. This would be more than sufficient for a huge number of cases and getting much faster might not even be worth it. If you are doing something like trying to get live uncompressed 4k video or something then sure you might need some fancy special purpose solution, but in the vast majority of cases something simple would work just as well. Plus, what are you actually using it for? Most online games have a waiting period when you load in to be sure everyone has a chance to load before games start, does it really matter if you load in 1 second and wait for 29 or load in 3 seconds and wait for 27?

            "sackbut----I'm trying to use an HGST 4tb drive as a data drive in Windows 7 32 bit. My MSI motherboard has the Intel G31/ICH7 chipset with the latest drivers (9.1.2.1008) and traditional AMI BIOS (1.7). From what I can find in Intel documentation, the G31/ICH7 chipset should support GPT. In theory it should work, but when partitioning times out after converting to GPT in either the console drive manager or diskpart.exe. The entire capacity of the drive is recognized (3725.9 GB) and converting to GPT worked fine. When I try partitioning (or partitioning and formatting) in Disk Manager, it takes a while, but then I get an error saying that the \"view is not up to date.\" Refreshing, restarting the Disk Manager, or restarting the computer does not help. Is there anything else I can try? Would putting the drive in an external enclosure and connecting it via USB (I only have 2.0) or eSATA with a separate PCI SATA controller card make any difference?",
            "Boogieman_WD----Hey sackbut. You could try connecting it externally as you've mentioned, hopefully this helps. But this shouldn't happen. I'd recommend that you try another HDD if you have any, with the same SATA connection to see if the cable hasn't gone faulty or something. Cheers,\nBoogieman_WD",
            "sackbut---- Pretty sure it's not the cable. I switched cables and the same thing happens. I don't have any other HDD &gt; 2tb available. Windows 7 Disk Manager and diskpart.exe see the drive with the proper capacity and allow me to convert it to GPT and clean it. The Paragon HGST GPT Disk Manager also seems to see the drive properly and tells me \"HGST ultra-capacity drive is already correctly recognized by your operating system. Additional driver installation is not required\" and goes on to tell me to use Windows Disk Manager to convert to GPT. I think I am going to try reinstalling Windows 7 as 64-bit (I downloaded the ISO) using the key from my 32-bit Windows 7 disk. I can't be sure, but I think Microsoft will let me do that for free. Of course, it requires a clean installation and therefore backing up and reinstalling all software and data, so it's a major pain, and might not solve the problem. Nobody seems to know anything about this!",
            "sackbut----One other thing - when I look at the drive in my BIOS setup, it is listed as a 4TB drive. I'm not sure if this proves the BIOS is supposed to support drives &gt; 2TB but it seems as if it might.",
            "sackbut----Here is a link to the HGST technical data that apparently hoodwinked me into thinking this should work without much hassle. http://www.hgst.com/support/high-capacity-hard-drives Notice that the chart at the bottom says that a high-capacity GPT drive will work as a data drive under Windows 7 32-bit using the Hitachi GPT Disk Manager, and that the BIOS is NOT a factor. Well, first of all, the Hitachi GPT Disk Manager itself gives me a message that says it is not needed with Windows 7 32-bit. Secondly, the tech support guy at Hitachi/WD told me on the phone that my BIOS might be the problem, in spite of what Hitachi's chart told me. My BIOS sees the 4TB capacity of the drive, so what is the problem? According to the chart, use as a data drive should even be possible with XP, so it seems they are saying even pretty old BIOS machines should work. Apparently Hitachi didn't do much testing before publishing their chart."

            "hst101rox----What software are you using? Yes a write based surface test (which requires a read first to then write back the data again) is needed to get the drive to remap the bad sectors (in S.M.A.R.T., going from 'Current Pending Sector Count' to 'Reallocated Sector Count') . First just get the data off that you want to save. You can try Ghost if it's a system drive (wanting all data backed up). If you can't then run HDD regenerator (free on bittorrent). If you want the bad sector to be remapped then also run that software. Spinrite can be another choice, or whatever software you are using now which I am curious what you are using because I haven't yet found a write based surface test that runs on windows -&gt; Instead I have to use a bootable CD.

            "hst101rox----Well reading again after reading and then writing is a time waster if you have everything backed up because data may already be corrupted so consider the data garbage on the drive and you'll save time. If the S.M.A.R.T. report says it has bad sectors then they may replace your drive but otherwise they probably will just send it back to you IMO. If the report is already bad then it's ready to be shipped out, if it's not then you could do stuff to cause some minor head crashes and deviant stuff like that but not my recommendation. If you want to see if the drive is still fit for use, look at the report. Is it running the scan now? Yeah just do read/write. If it stalls at times during the test then that is a bad sign (bad sector found). Look at the report after the test. This is a good guide on the SMART attributes to decipher what means what. ECC corrected, read errors are signs of data corruption without necessarily bad sectors counted. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T.",

            "tttmack----I have a 3TB Western Digital My Book External Hard drive. The drive was formatted as ext3 and connected to my router, but the enclosure seemed to be faulty since it was making weird sounds. I took the drive (WD30EZRX) out of the enclosure and put it into a new enclosure, that is known to be working, and connected it to my Win10 computer. My goal is to reformat the drive (I don't care about existing data) to NTFS. However, the drive does not show up in Disk Management. I do see it in Device Manager -&gt; Hard Drives however it is using a Microsoft Driver from 2006 and Update Drivers says I already have the newest. Is there any way I can salvage this drive and reformat it? If I could get it to appear under disk management then I could easily do this. Note that I also tried connecting it to my Mac and the drive did not appear under Disk Utility. thanks in advance for your help.",

Generally HDDs have a firm sounding operating set of sounds. If the drive dies sound weird, it's on it's way out. Act fast connect to USB adapter and try to rescue data to another computer. 2. The HDD could be overheating and has had component failure. If this is the case, you might be able to recover data. First remove the drive carefully. Put it in the freezer in a static proof bag. Leave for a few hours. Get another computer ready with plenty HDD space. Plug faulty drive into USB of other computer with a suitable adapter and try to start backing up. You may only get a few goes at this method before total component failure. Generally the fault is on the drive's motherboard. A replacement board from the same HDD model hdd will give you access to important data again. 3. Power supply to the drive maybe failing. Again, try using a USB adapter and plug HDD into a USB on another pc to see if access is possible and to check operations. My bet is the drive has lived a long and fruit full life, and has reached the end if it's journey. If data recivery is not an issye...then It is probably time to bury it. R.I.P",

If you take the drive out of the machine and place it in a waterproof anti-static bag, and then place in the freezer for about 10 minutes. Power it back up and test it. If it tends to be running at full speed until it warms up again, then it very well be an electrical component on the drive's Motherboard is about to fail. Could also be a Virus? Could also be the magnetic substrate in the drive's FAT/DATA area is failing and many reads need to be performed thus slowing performance? This could also apply to the drives magnetic read/write heads. Could be bad interface cable/connector logic line electrical contact problem due to vibration/grime etc...?

You have a new SSD and presumably intend that drive to function as your boot drive. I take it your present OS + all your present program data are contained on your HDD. Two questions for you to answer...\n1. Given the disk capacity of your SSD is it large enough to contain the total data contained on your HDD?\n2. Does your HDD - the present boot drive - function without any problems whatsoever? If your answers to the above questions are \"Yes\", then I think you should seriously consider using a disk-cloning program in order to \"migrate\" all the data contained on the HDD to your new SSD. It's a relatively simple &amp; straightforward process and avoids the somewhat awkward nature of the WSR process. Many SSDs are packaged by the manufacturer with a \"data migration\" program. Perhaps yours as well. And there are freely available disk-cloning programs available as well. One of them that we've used is the Macrium Reflex Free program which is available for download from http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/macrium_reflect_free_edition.html\nWe've used this program a number of times with no problems. After you complete the disk-cloning operation your HDD will still be intact and you can use that disk as a secondary drive for whatever purpose you want.

No matter what device you get, at the end of the cable it is an IDE port. ALL IDE ports are designed to support up to 2 devices, and REQUIRE that each device attached be identified. They also require that there be at least a MASTER device attached. Now, in cases of these adapters or enclosures, normally there actually is only space and connectors for ONE drive, but the IDE port still needs that device to be set as the Master (unless specifically noted otherwise in the adapter's documentation). So use the diagram on each drive (one drive's jumper position may not be the same as another's) to set it to Master when using it this way."

            "Pastrix----Darkbreeze, thank you for help. I am not very technical so can I just check - as I have no Desktop I could test it on my laptop if I get SATA cable/adapter, remove enclosure and connect to laptop. Alternatively I can get a replacement enclosure?",
            "Darkbreeze----Yes. And the type you get probably depends on whether that Buffalo unit has a 2.5\" or 3.5\" drive inside. If it's a desktop, not mobile style, external drive, then it probably has a 3.5\" drive inside, which means you'd need an enclosure for a 3.5\" drive. You don't want to get the cheapest enclosure you can find either, as many of them are simply junk. Even halfway good enclosures, and Buffalo usually has fairly good products, can fail, as you've probably seen from your current situation. Still, it's possible that it's actually the drive and not the unit. Before all that though, I'd try using a different USB cable. Cable failures are fairly common as well. Make sure there are no bent pins at either end of the cable or in the ports you're connecting them to. Might try a different port to connect to as well before going through the trouble of disassembling the enclosure.",
            "Pastrix----hi again, as you suggested, I connected my Buffalo external hard drive with SATA to my pc and I have same problem. it shows as \"usb drive\" for few minutes, than it changes to \"drive Buffalo\" and I can see all info (total space 320gb, free 100gb) for 3-4 minutes only. then again changes to \"USB drive\" (unknown drive) for 5 min then again to drive Buffalo etc. Its like it is disconnecting and connecting every 3-4 min. When I disconnected external HDD from my pc (it was still plugged into electricity through SATA) I heard the same noise, powering on and off. I don't need this drive, I just want to copy all my stuff to my PC but don't know how. Professionally it would cost more than my laptop!! Can someone suggest how can I copy my files please?"

Once your SSD is installed you can always run a Windows installer and re-install your OS to the SSD, otherwise it'll serve as secondary storage after you format it.

The interior was a rat nest and I was looking at all these clean builds so I decided I'd clean up my cables a bit and flsh the cooling loop. So... I DISCONNECTED ALL 4 HARD DRIVES (AND OTHER SATA CABLES) WITHOUT NOTING WHERE THEY CAME FROM - WHILE USING RAID STORAGE - and now once I have put it all back together it wont boot. No single beep, ...\"no drives found\" press f1 to .... reboot or insert .... BAH! Before I go into all my pc stats.. does running RAID and switching all the sata cables positions around completely B*****P me ? My rig ran fine for 2 years of great gaming..

Rather than you squabble with outdated 4xHDD in raid, its much more effective to just buy an SSD and install new window in it.

After 5 years, SSD has came into the game and already it is a must have for a high end build such as your build (yeah, your build still considered high end even though gpu might be outdated, but the rest still fine.) 500Gb SSD are should be no problem for you assuming you spend that kind of money 5 years ago. Trust me, its worth it. 1 SSD itself has almost 3 times (or more)the speed of HDD, so basically it should perform better and less hussle with Raid (oh and save electric bill) Here are list of SSD price in United states\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/products/internal-hard-drive/#t=0&amp;S=460000,10000000&amp;sort=a10&amp;page=1 I would recommended samsung 850 evo or pro.

Everything is absolutely fine, it's just when Windows doesn't shutdown properly, it resynchronizes the data on the mirror drives. It's a safety feature automatically implemented by Windows, and is not meant to cause any trouble. The resync process will complete so long as you leave your computer on, or will completely restart if you turn it off. You can monitor its progress by opening Storage Management (where you were) and refreshing the page. After a few minutes, you will see resync progress determined by a percentage that increments in multiples of 3. The speed of the resync is determined by how much you have stored and the read speed of the drives, etc. The resync process will consume a small but notable amount of processing power, so I usually do not game during resync, but feel free to do anything else. Hope this helps! ALSO: You can avoid this all together by setting up a hard RAID 1 at the motherboard/BIOS level, but that will involve wiping both drives to set up, and it can make determining drive health a bit more difficult",

Would this pose any danger to any of the hardware?",

First, i tried to clone my disk hdd 120g to my new disk 120G SSD and dont boot. There are many reason for this, but in second place i tried to format and do a clean install...... i try this with DISKPART, with win7 DVD, with ubuntu dvd, with partition wizard, and no way. When Windows reboot, ocurre an error 0x0000007b and reboot in a loop. My problem is that i dont know what is my problem! I need a solution.... but first, what i am doing wrong? Few days ago, i prepared a desktop pc with a new mother asus h81 with a celeron, and with the SAME DISK, i test the SAME actions (format with the win dvd, the SAME DVD), and win7 dont present any problem. Now, i know the disk is right and my old laptop is well with its old disk hdd. **This new mother had like default the ahci mode ON. i any driver or action i can do, for win7 install on this situation? my pc is this: https://www.cnet.com/products/acer-aspire-5520-5155-15-4-turion-64-x2-tl-56-2-gb-ram-120-gb-hdd/specs/ Thx for any solutions.

            "Boogieman_WD----Hey there, phakuphaku. When you say \"with the SAME DISK, i test the SAME actions\" do you mean that you've tested only the Win 7 DVD, or do you mean that you've tried installing Windows on the SSD in question? Because it's quite possible for the SSD to be having issues if everything works fine without it and you can't even make a fresh install. I'd suggest that you try it with a different computer and download an SSD diagnostic tool to test it for errors, to see if anything unusual pops-up. You could also check its manufacturer's website for available firmware updates. As for the AHCI option. This should be set before you install Windows on the SSD if you are doing a fresh install. You should have something like SATA mode which you can change from by using your BIOS. If it's set to IDE now, you won't see the actual AHCI before you click and change it. Since it's different for different BIOS/UEFI versions, I'd suggest that you check the laptop's User Manual on how to switch the SATA controller's mode from IDE to AHCI. Hope that helps. Please let me know how everything goes.\nBoogieman_WD",
            "phakuphaku---- My friend, thank for your answer.\nIf my laptop had an option for change sata mode, i had found it. it doesnt have. Maybe a real sata1 the first edition, a lot before of AHCI Mode.. or when the legacy mode, was the only mode.\nWhen a purchase a new disk, i will try your comments. This SSD is working with a pc i build for a friend for a ciber, runs every day fine and i dont think it had a problem.\nThank you!",
            "Boogieman_WD----Perhaps there's some sort of incompatibility issue if the SSD is working fine with the same installation media and a different computer. If you still want to try and use it with the old laptop, I'd suggest that you give it a head with the firmware update recommendation from my previous post.\nYou could also try updating or resetting the laptop's BIOS, to see if that changes anything.

My question is this - how likely am I to notice the difference in performance with normal use, gaming, etc.?",
            "geofelt----5400rpm drives have higher latency and will be slower. My suggestion, since you have two spots for drives would be to use a SSD on one, for the os, and parhaps a few games.\nUse the other for storage. With a ssd, I would be OK with a 5400rpm drive, but 7200rpm would be faster. For data security, you need EXTERNAL backup.\nThe value of raid-1 and it's variants like raid-5 is that you can recover from a drive failure quickly. It is for servers that can not tolerate any interruption.\nModern hard drives have a advertised mean time to failure on the order of 500,000+ hours. That is something like 50 years. SSD's are similar. With raid-1 you are protecting yourself from specifically a hard drive failure. Not from other failures such as viruses, operator error, malware, fire, theft, etc.\nFor that, you need external backup. If you have external backup, and can tolerate some recovery time, you do not need raid-1",

            "geofelt----Raid-0 will give you nice results in sequential benchmarks, but not in everyday usage which is mostly random, not sequential.\nRaid-1 will cost you a bit, due to the need to do double updates. But mostly, it will hurt you because the access times of 5400rpm drives is longer than with 7200rpm drives. That shows up in random access times, which we do mostly. If you have any option at all, buy a SSD. It will transform the performance of any laptop.",

In most cases if the two operating systems are on two separate drives, you'll need to select which drive you want to use in order to boot to its OS. You can chose which OS you want to boot to, if it's a dual-boot on a single drive.\nAs for how to do it, you should go to the boot priority menu in your BIOS/UEFI and select the drive with the OS you want to use as the first booting option. Some BIOS/UEFIs have a quick boot priority menu which does not require you to enter it and navigate through the settings. However, you'll have to check your motherboard's User Manual in order to see how to do that. Oh, and one last thing, make sure that you have only the drive you're installing Windows to, connected to the motherboard during the installation process. This is necessary in order to avoid possible future booting issues. Please let me know how it goes."

Hopefully, i've provided enough information as to the specifics of the problem. Waiting on a reply, R.",
            "ArtPog----I've never heard of that Techly device which according to a Google search indicates it's simply a USB external enclosure that's designed to house 2.5\" drives. I take it that it's marketed in Europe. We in the U.S. would not refer to a device of this type as a \"removable disk tray\". We use that latter term to denote a removable HDD/SSD (usually) housed in a mobile rack installed in one of a desktop PC's external bays (either 3 1/2\" or 5 1/4\") and the connection between the mobile rack and the system is a direct SATA data connection to one of the motherboard's SATA ports. So as a practical matter the drive encased in the mobile rack functions as an INTERNALLY-CONNECTED SATA drive. Your device is a USB device; I trust you understand that. So presumably you're connecting the device via a USB cable to a USB port available on your PC (laptop? desktop?). As best I can tell from your query the problem you're experiencing is that the PC does not detect USB externally connected drive. Presumably if you connect the SSD internally in the system it is detected. But that's not clear from your post. It would help if you provided specific &amp; detailed info re the problem you're experiencing. Perhaps it's a defective USB enclosure, defective cable or some such. Are you intending to use this SSD as a boot drive?",

Note that device manager gives no sign of any malfunction/warning whatsoever. Lastly, cables and such have all been checked, they work. The device DOES work properly on other PC's/Laptops as stated before. The intention is to use it as a removable SSD in order to quickly swap data between the several PC's i have in my house.",
            "ArtPog----1. As you have indicated we'll assume the USB-connected SSD is non-defective, and,\n2. You have tried other USB cables and connected the USB external drive to other USB ports with no problem, and we'll assume...\n3. If you remove the SSD from the USB enclosure and install it internally in a PC as a secondary drive it will function without any problems, and...\n4. We'll assume there's no problem with the USB ports on the laptop in that you've been able to connect other USB devices to those ports without any problems arising.\n5. Can we also assume that if you substitute another HDD/SSD in that USB enclosure there's no problem? If all the assumptions listed above are correct I honestly am at a loss to even guess why this problem is arising.",

I broke the sata data connector on my seagate drive so after an inadequate amount of research I ordered a new pcb. The serial on the original board is 100574451 rev b. I ordered the same one, and was told that the revision didn't matter on this board. The one I got said rev a. I installed it and the drive is getting power (good) but just making clicking sounds. Being detected, but not showing up in the file browser. now all I have to do is get the bios chip swapped. Here's where my question comes in. I found (the internets told me) that there's specific information on the platters and that's why pcb swaps don't really work. I didn't exactly want to hear this. I spent most of my money on this board (angry young and poor here) my questions are does the revision matter, and will this work at all due to some of the information being on the platters?

Even, some different board number boards can be used as same too, such as 100535537 and 100650117. If you don't understand, you can make a test.

If you don't have to rush for a larger capacity drive and want to boost your system's performance, then go for the SSD first.

            "Chicano---- 1. With a Windows DVD or USB installer, this is what you can do... \nOr you can perform a bootloader repair with the Bootrec (bootrec.exe) utility\nhttps://neosmart.net/wiki/bootrec/ 2. Without a Windows installer, you may be able to run a Startup/Automatic Repair selecting the repair from the Safe Mode options, but only if you have the recovery partition which is created when Windows is originally installed... without the recovery partition you will not have the repair option in the safe mode list... To check that, press F8 right after the BIOS post and beep.\nhttp://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/SLN151680/en?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;cs=04\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/howto/32523/how-to-manually-repair-windows-7-boot-loader-problems/ 3. Without install media or recovery partition, your options are: a) EasyBCD to repair the bootloader as instructed before... you can use EasyBCD to delete the corrupted bootloader and with the boot entries you add it will create a new bootloader. b) The Hiren's Boot CD/USB to repair the Windows bootloader with one of the tools included.\nhttp://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd-on-usb-disk "

            "michael_anderson---- Recently, I encountered a similar problem. My Nikon micro SD card crashed and can not be recognized by the camera and my computer. In order to recover lost pictures and video files as much as possible, I studied a lot of knowledge about data recovery. Finally, I developed the card data recovery steps: 1) Immediately stop shooting new photos, and do not write new files to the SD card. This is to avoid original SD card pictures and videos be overwritten by the new files. Note: Once the missing files are overwritten, they’ll completely disappear (and can not be restored)!\n2) Try a few data recovery tools (or picture recovery tools) from different companies. If the SD card can be identified by the data recovery software, then it is possible to find the missing files. Note: Save the recovered files to your computer’s hard drive. Do not save them to the same SD card.\n3) If there is no data recovery software that can recognize the SD card, then you have to format the card. Lastly, repeat the second step for data recovery. According to the above steps, I got back most of the lost pictures and video files. I hope that these experiences also help you and other friends!"
